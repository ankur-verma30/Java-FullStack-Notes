📌 Git Basics & Commands
➤ Git → A distributed version control system (DVCS) used to track changes in source code.
➤ VCS (Version Control System): Manages changes, tracks history, allows rollbacks, and enables collaboration.
➤ DVCS vs CVCS:
    ✔️ DVCS → Each developer has a full copy of the repo (with complete history).
    ✔️ CVCS → Single central repository, developers depend on it for history.

🔄 What is a Repository?
➤ A repository is a storage location for source code + history.
➤ Git Repository: A repo managed by Git.
➤ Types:
    ✔️ Local Repo → Stored on your computer.
    ✔️ Remote Repo → Stored on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

🔄 Configure Git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"

Email is used to associate commits with your GitHub/GitLab account.

📌 Common Git Commands
🔄 Directory & File Management
🔗 ls → Show directory content (Linux).
🔗 ls -al → Show all files (including hidden) in long format (Linux).
🔗 Get-ChildItem -Force → PowerShell equivalent of ls -al.
🔗 rm -rf .git/ → Remove .git folder → uninitialize Git repo.

🔄 Initialize & Status
🔗 git init → Initialize Git repository in current directory.
🔗 git status → Show working directory & staging area status.

❌ Error: fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git → means Git repo not initialized.

🔄 Staging Files
🔗 git add fileName1 fileName2 → Stage specific files.
🔗 git add . → Stage all files.
🔗 git rm --cached fileName → Remove file from staging area (but keep in working directory).

🔄 Commit
🔗 git commit -m "message" → Commit staged changes.
🔗 git commit -am "message" → Stage and commit tracked files in one step.

🔄 Commit History
🔗 git log → Show commit history.

🔄 Vim Editor Notes (when commit opens in Vim)
🔗 :q! → Quit without saving.
🔗 :wq → Save and quit.

📌 Git Branching & Related Commands
🔄 Branch Management
🔗 git branch branchName → Create a new branch.
🔗 git branch -d branchName → Delete a branch (safe delete).
🔗 git branch -D branchName → Force delete branch (unsafe).
🔗 git branch → List all branches, highlight current branch (*).

🔄 Switching Branches
🔗 git switch branchName → Switch to a branch (newer syntax).
🔗 git switch - → Switch to previous branch.
🔗 git switch -c branchName → Create and switch to a new branch.

🔄 Older Syntax (Checkout for Branches)
🔗 git checkout branchName → Switch to a branch.
🔗 git checkout -b branchName → Create and switch to a new branch.
🔗 git checkout - → Switch to previous branch.

⚠️ Note: git checkout is older and more confusing (used for both branch & file ops).
git switch and git restore were introduced to make it cleaner.

📌 File Operations
🔗 git checkout fileName → Discard uncommitted changes in specific file (irreversible).
🔗 git checkout . → Discard uncommitted changes in all files (irreversible).
🔗 cat fileName → View file content.
🔗 cat -n fileName → View file content with line numbers.

⚠️ For discarding changes, newer syntax is:
🔗 git restore fileName → Discard changes in a file.
🔗 git restore . → Discard changes in all files.

📌 Logs & Commit Management
🔗 git log --oneline → Show commit history in one-line format (compact).
🔗 git log --graph --oneline --all → Visual branch structure + history.
🔗 git commit --amend -m "new message" → Change last commit message.
🔗 git commit --amend → Edit last commit (can also add new changes).

⚠️ If commit was already pushed to remote → avoid amending (it rewrites history).

touch .gitignore → Create .gitignore file.
pwd → Show current directory(print working directory).

🔷 Git Branches
In Git, a branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit.
It represents an independent line of development.
When you create a branch, you're essentially creating a copy of your codebase at that point.

🔷 Merging the branch
git merge branchName → Merge a branch into the current branch.(Go to the branch in which you want to merge the changes. and run this Command).
For example if you want to merge the changes of branch "dev" into the master branch, run the command "git merge dev" on master branch.

git branch -D branchName → Delete a branch (unsafe) force deletion takes place.
git branch -m "newName" → Rename a branch (unsafe)

git diff → Show changes between working directory and staging area.
git diff --staged → Show changes between staging area and the last commit.
git diff commit1 commit2 → Show changes between two commits.


🗂️ Git Stash Commands – Notes
Stash temporarily shelves (or “stashes”) changes you’ve made in your working directory.

Useful when you:
➤ Want to switch branches without committing changes.
➤ Save uncommitted changes and reapply them later.

🔄 Common Git Stash Commands
🔗 git stash
➤ Stashes current changes (both staged + unstaged).
➤ Cleans working directory back to the last commit state.

🔗 git stash list → Shows list of all stashed changes with IDs like stash@{0}, stash@{1}, etc.
🔗 git stash pop → Applies latest stashed changes and removes them from stash.
🔗 git stash apply → Applies latest stashed changes without removing from stash.
➤ Can also apply specific stash: git stash apply stash@{2}
🔗 git stash drop stash@{n} → Deletes a specific stash entry.
🔗 git stash clear → Removes all stash entries.

🔄 Stashing with Names / Messages
🔗 git stash push -- "fileName" → Stash specific file changes.
🔗 git stash -m "message" "fileName" → Stash with a custom message for clarity.

🔄 Viewing Stashed Changes
🔗 git stash show stash@{n} → Shows summary of changes in stash.
🔗 git stash show -p stash@{n} → Shows detailed patch (line-by-line diff).

🔄 Advanced Options
🔗 git stash --keep-index → Stash only unstaged changes, keeps staged files intact.
🔗 git stash --include-untracked → Stash both tracked + untracked files.

🗂️ Git Restore Commands – Notes
Introduced in Git 2.23 (2019) as a safer alternative to git checkout.
Used to discard changes in the working directory or staging area.
Helps to avoid accidental overwriting when using git checkout.

🔄 Common Commands
🔗 git restore --staged <file> → Unstages a file (moves it from staging → working directory).
Similar to: 🔗 git reset HEAD <file>

🔗 git restore <file> → Discards local changes from working directory (file reverts to last committed state).

🔗 git restore --staged --worktree <file> → Restores a file from staging area → working directory.
🔗 git restore --staged --worktree . → Restores all files from staging → working directory.

🔄 Restoring from Commits
🔗 git restore --source=HEAD <file> → Restores file from last commit (HEAD).
🔗 git restore --source=HEAD . → Restores all files from last commit.

🔗 git restore --source=HEAD~n <file> → Restores file(s) from n commits before HEAD.
✅Example: 🔗 git restore --source=HEAD~2 file.txt → Brings back file state from 2 commits ago.


🗂️ Git Reset Commands – Notes
➤ Used to move HEAD (the current branch pointer) to another commit.
➤ Can also affect staging area (index) and working directory depending on mode.
➤ ⚠️ Dangerous if used carelessly (especially --hard), as it can permanently delete changes.

🔄 Common Uses
🌟 1. Unstage Changes

🔗 git reset
➤ Unstages all staged files.
➤ Equivalent to: git restore --staged .

🌟 2. Undo Last Commit (3 Modes)
🔗 git reset --soft HEAD~1
➤ Removes the last commit.
➤ Keeps all changes in staging area.
➤ Use when you want to redo the commit.

🔗 git reset --mixed HEAD~1 (default)
➤ Removes the last commit.
➤ Moves changes back to working directory (unstaged).
➤ Use when you want to edit files before recommitting.

🔗 git reset --hard HEAD~1
➤ Removes the last commit.
➤ Discards changes completely (irreversible).
➤ Use with caution 🚨.

🌟 3. Reset to a Specific Commit
🔗 git reset --soft <commit-hash>
➤ Moves HEAD to that commit.
➤ Keeps changes staged.

🔗 git reset --mixed <commit-hash>
➤ Moves HEAD to that commit.
➤ Keeps changes in working directory (unstaged).

🔗 git reset --hard <commit-hash>
➤ Moves HEAD to that commit.
➤ Discards everything after that commit (changes lost).

| Mode      | HEAD moves | Staging Area (Index) | Working Directory |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| `--soft`  | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Keeps staged       | ✅ Keeps changes   |
| `--mixed` | ✅ Yes      | ❌ Unstaged           | ✅ Keeps changes   |
| `--hard`  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ Cleared            | ❌ Cleared (lost)  |

🗂️ Git Revert Commands
➤ Safely undoes a commit by creating a new commit that reverses the changes.
➤ Unlike git reset, it does not delete history (safer for shared branches).
🔗 git revert <commit-hash>→ Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by <commit-hash>.

✅ When to Use:
➤ When working in collaborative projects where you don’t want to rewrite history.
➤ To undo a buggy commit while keeping commit history intact.

⚠️ Note:
May trigger a merge conflict if changes overlap — resolve manually, then commit.

🔷 Git Alias (Shortcuts)
Aliases make Git commands shorter & faster. They are stored in .gitconfig.

✅ Example .gitconfig setup:
[alias]
    co = commit -m
    ch = checkout
    br = branch
    st = status
    lo = log
    lo1 = log --oneline
    df = diff

🌟 Creating an Alias via Command
General Syntax:
git config --global alias.<shortcut> "<full command>"

✅ Examples:
🔗 git config --global alias.co "commit -m" → Now git co "msg" = git commit -m "msg"
🔗 git config --global alias.st "status" → Now git st = git status
🔗 git config --global alias.lo1 "log --oneline" → Now git lo1 = git log --oneline
