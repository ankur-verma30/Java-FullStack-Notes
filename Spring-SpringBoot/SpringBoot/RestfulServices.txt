============================
🔷 Distributed Application
===========================
A distributed application is an application where components are spread across multiple computers (nodes) connected through a network, but they work together as a single system.
➤ They are used for Business to Business commnication unlike web applciaton communicate with Business to Client (C2B).

⚙️ Key Idea:
Instead of all logic running on one server (like in a monolithic app), different parts — frontend, backend, databases, microservices, etc. — run on different machines or locations and communicate via network protocols (like HTTP, RPC, or gRPC).

✅ Example: E-commerce Application
➤ Frontend (React app) ─────────▶ runs on user’s browser.
➤ Backend API (Spring Boot) ─────────▶ runs on AWS server.
➤ Database (MySQL) ─────────▶ runs on a separate database server.
➤ Payment service (third-party) ─────────▶ hosted externally.
👉 All these parts interact to form one working e-commerce platform — that’s a distributed application.


🔄 Characteristics:
➤ Multiple independent nodes (different machines).
➤ Communication over network (e.g., REST, gRPC).
➤ Data sharing and synchronization between components.
➤ Scalability – you can scale specific services independently.
➤ Fault tolerance – if one node fails, others can still run.


🧱 Architecture Examples:
➤ Client–Server (basic distributed system 2-Tier Architecture)
➤ 3-Tier Architecture (UI, Application Server, Database)
➤ Microservices Architecture (each service deployed independently)
➤ Cloud-Native Applications (services running across data centers)


🧰 Technologies Used:
➤ APIs / REST / gRPC for communication
➤ Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for async communication
➤ Databases like MongoDB, Cassandra (distributed data)
➤ Load Balancers for traffic distribution
➤ Containers / Kubernetes for deployment


🔁 Another Scenario of Distributed Application
✅Example:MMT ↔ IRCTC — A Real Distributed Interaction Example
➤ Both MMT (MakeMyTrip) and IRCTC are independent distributed systems,
but they interact with each other over a network to complete a single user request.
➤ That interaction itself makes the overall system — the combination of MMT + IRCTC + users — a larger distributed ecosystem.
➤ MMT doesn’t own the train data — it connects to IRCTC’s distributed system through APIs.
➤ Both systems communicate and cooperate over the internet, while users experience it as one smooth platform.
➤ XML and JSON data will be used as mediaters to transfer data between MMT and IRCTC.


=====================
🔷 Intereoperability
=====================
➤ The term interoperability refers to the ability of two or more systems to work together, even if they are not built for the same purpose or use the same architecture.
➤ It is a way to ensure that different systems can communicate and exchange data with each other, even if they are built using different technologies or have different interfaces.


========
🔷 XML
========
XML (Xtensible Markup Language) is a markup language used to store and transport data in a structured, human-readable, and machine-readable format.

✅ Example:
<Student>  -------------> compound eleement containing other elements
    <Name>Ankur Verma</Name>--------> simple element
    <RollNo>101</RollNo>
    <Branch>Information Technology</Branch>
</Student>
👉 This stores structured data about a student — not for displaying (like HTML), but for data exchange.


🔄 Key Features:
➤ Self-descriptive ─────────▶ Tags describe the data.
➤ Custom tags ─────────▶ You can define your own (unlike HTML’s fixed tags).
➤ Platform-independent ─────────▶ Works across systems and languages.
➤ Hierarchical structure ─────────▶ Data stored in parent ─ child format.
➤ Supports validation ─────────▶ You can define structure rules using:
    ✔️  DTD (Document Type Definition)
    ✔️  XSD (XML Schema Definition)


🔄 Common Uses:
➤ Configuration files (e.g., web.xml in Java web apps)
➤ Data exchange between systems (SOAP APIs, web services)
➤ Document storage (e.g., Office files internally use XML)
➤Serialization (saving objects in XML format)


==========================================================================================================================
🔷 JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) — also called JAX-B API (Deprecated Not used in SpringBoot it is Automated)
==========================================================================================================================
✔️ JAXB is a Java API that allows you to convert Java objects into XML (marshalling) and XML back into Java objects (unmarshalling) easily.
✔️ It’s part of the Jakarta / Java EE (formerly JAX-B) stack and simplifies XML handling in Java applications — no manual parsing required.

Upto Java 1.8 JAXB was part of the Java SE platform but removed from Java 1.9 version if you want to use should have a jax-b dependency.

🔄 Core Operations
1️⃣ Marshalling ─────────▶ Converts Java objects into XML.
2️⃣ Unmarshalling ─────────▶ Converts XML into Java objects.
3️⃣ Binding ─────────▶ Maps Java classes to XML elements and attributes.
4️⃣ Validation ─────────▶ Validates XML against a schema.
5️⃣ Schema Generation ─────────▶ Generates XML schemas from Java classes.

✅ Example: 1️⃣ Create a java class
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement;
import jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement;

@XmlRootElement(name = "student")
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int rollNo;

    // Default constructor (required by JAXB)
    public Student() {}

    public Student(String name, int rollNo) {
        this.name = name;
        this.rollNo = rollNo;
    }

    @XmlElement
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    @XmlElement
    public int getRollNo() {
        return rollNo;
    }
}

2️⃣ Marshalling(Java --> XML)
import jakarta.xml.bind.JAXBContext;
import jakarta.xml.bind.Marshaller;

public class MarshallExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Student s = new Student("Ankur Verma", 101);
        JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(Student.class);
        Marshaller marshaller = context.createMarshaller();
        marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);
        marshaller.marshal(s, System.out); // prints XML to console
    }
}
✅ Output XML:
<student>
    <name>Ankur Verma</name>
    <rollNo>101</rollNo>
</student>

3️⃣ Unmarshalling(XML --> Java)
import jakarta.xml.bind.Unmarshaller;
import java.io.File;

public class UnmarshallExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(Student.class);
        Unmarshaller unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();
        Student s = (Student) unmarshaller.unmarshal(new File("student.xml"));
        System.out.println(s.getName() + " - " + s.getRollNo());
    }
}
✅ Output:
Ankur Verma - 101

🔄 Real-World Use Cases:
➤ Converting XML payloads in SOAP web services
➤ Reading/writing config files in XML
➤ Data exchange between Java systems via XML
➤ Used in Spring Boot (for XML-based request/response mapping)


=======================================
🔷 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
=======================================
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format used to store and exchange data between a client and a server.

It’s language-independent, but easily readable by both humans and machines.

✅ Example:
{
  "name": "Ankur Verma",
  "rollNo": 101,
  "branch": "Information Technology"
}

🔄 Key Features of JSON:
➤ Lightweight – smaller and faster than XML
➤ Easy to parse – simple key-value structure
➤ Language-independent
➤ Key-value pair format
➤ Used widely in REST APIs
➤ Supports basic data types: string, number, boolean, array, object, null


🔄JSON in Java (Working & Usage)(Built-in Support in Modern SpringBoot Versions)
Java doesn’t have built-in JSON support, but several popular libraries make it easy to convert between Java objects and JSON:

Common libraries:
➤ Jackson (most popular, used by Spring Boot)
➤ Gson (by Google)
➤ org.json

1️⃣ Using Jackson Library (Most Common in Spring Boot)
✅ Example of Java Class:
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int rollNo;

    public Student() {}
    public Student(String name, int rollNo) {
        this.name = name;
        this.rollNo = rollNo;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }

    public int getRollNo() { return rollNo; }
    public void setRollNo(int rollNo) { this.rollNo = rollNo; }
}

🌀 Object ─────────▶ JSON (Serialization)
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class ObjectToJson {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Student s = new Student("Ankur Verma", 101);
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

        String jsonString = mapper.writeValueAsString(s);
        // for adding the json to a file
        // mapper.writeValue(new File("student.json"), s);
        System.out.println(jsonString);
    }
}

✅ Output:
{"name":"Ankur Verma","rollNo":101}

🔁 JSON ─────────▶ Object (Deserialization)
public class JsonToObject {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String jsonString = "{\"name\":\"Ankur Verma\",\"rollNo\":101}";
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

        Student s = mapper.readValue(jsonString, Student.class);
        System.out.println(s.getName() + " - " + s.getRollNo());
    }
}
✅ Output:
Ankur Verma - 101

2️⃣ Using Gson Library (Alternative)
import com.google.gson.Gson;

public class GsonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student("Ankur", 101);
        Gson gson = new Gson();

        // Object ─────────▶ JSON
        String json = gson.toJson(s);
        System.out.println(json);

        // JSON ─────────▶ Object
        Student obj = gson.fromJson(json, Student.class);
        System.out.println(obj.getName());
    }
}

Spring Boot automatically uses Jackson internally for JSON conversion.

🔄 Real-World Use Cases:
➤ Reading/writing config files in JSON
➤ Data exchange between Java systems via JSON


==================
🔷 HTTP protocol
==================
➤ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a client-server communication protocol used for transmitting data over the web.
➤ It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.
➤ It is a stateless protocol. It will treat each request independently.


❓How It Works
➤ Client sends a request ─────────▶ (e.g., a web browser or REST client sends an HTTP request to the server).
➤ Server processes the request ─────────▶ The web server receives the request, processes it, and prepares a response.
➤ Server sends back a response ─────────▶ The server returns an HTTP response (status code + data).
➤ Connection may close (in HTTP/1.1 or remain open for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3).


🌟 Basic Structure
1️⃣ HTTP Request Structure
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Chrome/108.0
Accept: text/html


2️⃣ HTTP Response Structure
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234

<html>
<body>Hello, World!</body>
</html>

🔄 Common HTTP Methods
| Method     | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| GET        | Retrieve data from the server (no body).          |
| POST       | Send data to the server (used for creating data). |
| PUT        | Update existing resource completely.              |
| PATCH      | Update part of a resource.                        |
| DELETE     | Delete a resource.                                |
| HEAD       | Same as GET but returns only headers.             |


=====================
🔷 HTTP Status Codes
======================
➤ An HTTP status code is a three-digit numeric code returned by a web server as part of the response to an HTTP request made by a client.
➤ These status codes are used to convey information about the result or status of the requested operation.
➤ HTTP status codes are grouped into five categories based on the first digit of the code:

1️⃣ 1xx (Informational) ─────────▶ These status codes indicate that the request was received and understood, and the server is continuing to process it.
These are typically used for informational purposes and are not commonly seen in everyday web interactions.


2️⃣ 2xx (Successful) ─────────▶ These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server.
  ✔️ 200 OK ─────────▶ The request has been successfully processed, and the server is returning the requested resource.
  ✔️ 201 Created ─────────▶ The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
  ✔️ 204 No Content ─────────▶ The request has been fulfilled, but there is no response body(typically used for operation that don't return data, like a DELETE request).


3️⃣ 3xx (Redirection) ─────────▶ These status codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request. These are used when the client needs to take additional steps to access the requested resource.
  ✔️ 301 Moved Permanently ─────────▶ The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
  ✔️ 302 Found ─────────▶ The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL. When server sends a response with a 302 status code, it typically includes a Location header that specifies the new URL where the resource can be found. The client is expected to make a new request to this URL to access the resource.
  ✔️ 304 Not Modified ─────────▶ The resource has not been modified since the last request. The client can use its cached version.


4️⃣ 4xx (Client Error) ─────────▶ It indicates that there was an error on the client's side, such as malformed request or authentication issues.
  ✔️ 400 Bad Request ─────────▶ The server cannot process the request due to client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
  ✔️ 401 Unauthorized ─────────▶ Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
  ✔️ 403 Forbidden ─────────▶ The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
  ✔️ 404 Not Found ─────────▶ The requested resource could not be found on the server.


5️⃣ 5xx (Server Error) ─────────▶ The server failed to fulfill a valid request.
  ✔️ 500 Internal Server Error ─────────▶ A generic error message indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition.
  ✔️ 502 Bad Gateway ─────────▶ The server received an invalid response from an inbound server while acting as a gateway or proxy.
  ✔️ 503 Service Unavailable ─────────▶ The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance.

| Code Range | Meaning       | Example                        |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1xx        | Informational | 100 Continue                   |
| 2xx        | Success       | 200 OK, 201 Created            |
| 3xx        | Redirection   | 301 Moved Permanently          |
| 4xx        | Client Error  | 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found |
| 5xx        | Server Error  | 500 Internal Server Error      |

🔄 Features
➤ Stateless ─────────▶ Each request is independent; no session info is stored by default.
➤ Text-based ─────────▶ Human-readable request and response format.
➤ Extensible ─────────▶ Supports custom headers, cookies, and authentication.
➤ Uses TCP (Port 80) or HTTPS (Port 443) for secure communication.


====================================
🔷 HTTP Request and HTTP Response
====================================
1️⃣ HTTP Request
An HTTP request is a message sent by the client (like a browser or app) to ask the server to perform an action — such as fetching data, submitting a form, or deleting a record.

🔄 Structure of an HTTP Request
Method  URL  Protocol-Version
Headers
(blank line)
Body (optional)

✅ Example:
GET /users?id=10 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Chrome/121.0
Accept: application/json

🔄 Main Components:
➤ Request Line
    ✔️ Includes HTTP method, URL, and HTTP version.
    ✅ Example: GET /home HTTP/1.1
➤ Headers
    ✔️ Provide additional info like content type, authentication, etc.
    ✅ Example:
            Content-Type: application/json
            Authorization: Bearer token123
➤ Body (Optional)
    ✔️ Carries data with requests like POST, PUT, or PATCH.
    ✅ Example:
        {
          "name": "Ankur",
          "email": "ankur@gmail.com"
        }

2️⃣ HTTP Response
An HTTP response is the message sent by the server back to the client after processing the request.


====================
🔷 Headers in HTTP
====================
➤ HTTP Headers are key-value pairs sent between the client and server in an HTTP request or response.
➤ They carry metadata about the request/response — such as content type, authorization token, user agent, etc.

✅ Example of Common HTTP Headers
GET /api/weather HTTP/1.1
Host: api.weatherstack.com
Authorization: Bearer abc123
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.32.2

👉 Here:
    ✔️ Authorization ─────────▶ carries credentials or API keys
    ✔️ Content-Type ─────────▶ tells the server the data format (JSON, XML, etc.)
    ✔️ User-Agent ─────────▶ describes the client making the request


=========================================================
🔷 Pass Headers in Code (Spring Boot using RestTemplate)
=========================================================
import org.springframework.http.*;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@Service
public class WeatherService {

    private static final String API = "https://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key={key}&query={city}";

    private final RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    public WeatherResponse getWeather(String apiKey, String city) {

        // 1️⃣ Create headers
        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.set("Accept", "application/json"); // tells server to respond in JSON
        headers.set("User-Agent", "SpringBootApp");
        headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer some_token_here"); // example of passing token

        // 2️⃣ Build HttpEntity (headers + body)
        HttpEntity<String> entity = new HttpEntity<>(headers);

        // 3️⃣ Send request
        ResponseEntity<WeatherResponse> response = restTemplate.exchange(
                API,
                HttpMethod.GET,
                entity,                // includes headers
                WeatherResponse.class,
                apiKey, city           // replaces placeholders in URL
        );

        // 4️⃣ Return only body
        return response.getBody();
    }
}


🔄 Sending Headers + Body in a POST request
String url = "https://api.example.com/users";

// 1️⃣ Create headers
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer xyz123");

// 2️⃣ Create request body
User user = new User("Ankur", "ankur@example.com");

// 3️⃣ Combine headers and body
HttpEntity<User> entity = new HttpEntity<>(user, headers);

// 4️⃣ Make POST request
ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.exchange(
        url,
        HttpMethod.POST,
        entity,
        String.class
);

🔄 Key Classes for HTTP Headers in Spring
| Class                   | Description                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `HttpHeaders            | Represents HTTP header values                      |
| `HttpEntity<T>           | Represents request entity (headers + body)         |
| `ResponseEntity<T>       | Represents the response (status, headers, body)    |
| `MediaType              | Helps specify content type like `application/json` |


🔄 Common HTTP Headers and Their Purposes
| Header          | Purpose                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Type`  | Tells server what type of data is being sent (`application/json`) |
| `Accept`        | Tells server what response format client expects                  |
| `Authorization` | Sends tokens, API keys, or credentials                            |
| `User-Agent`    | Identifies client making the request                              |
| `Cache-Control` | Caching policies                                                  |
| `Custom-Header` | You can define your own headers                                   |


🔄 Structure of an HTTP Response
Protocol-Version Status-Code Status-Message
Headers
(blank line)
Body (optional)

✅ Example:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 47
{
  "id": 10,
  "name": "Ankur",
  "email": "ankur@gmail.com"
}

🔄 Main Components:
➤ Status Line
✅ Example: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    🔗 Includes:
        ✔️ HTTP version (HTTP/1.1)
        ✔️ Status code (200)
        ✔️ Status message (OK)
➤ Headers
    ✔️ Give info about the response.
    ✅ Example:
        Content-Type: text/html
        Cache-Control: no-cache
➤ Body (Optional)
    ✔️ Contains the actual data (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.)

🔄 Request–Response Flow Example
🔗 Client (Browser):
    GET /products HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.shop.com

🔗 Server (Response):
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    [{"id":1,"name":"Laptop","price":50000}]


==============================
🔷 Media Types in Rest API
==============================
➤ A Media Type (or MIME type) tells the format of data being sent or received in an HTTP message.
➤ It helps the client and server understand how to interpret the request or response body.

💡 Syntax: type/subtype

✅ Examples:
| Media Type            | Description           |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `application/json`    | JSON data             |
| `application/xml`     | XML data              |
| `text/html`           | HTML content          |
| `text/plain`          | Plain text            |
| `multipart/form-data` | Used for file uploads |
| `application/pdf`     | PDF file              |
| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | HTML form submissions |


1️⃣ Media Type in HTTP Request
When a client sends data (like in a POST or PUT request), it uses the Content-Type header to specify the format.
✅ Example:
POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Ankur",
  "email": "ankur@gmail.com"
}
➡️ This tells the server that the body is in JSON format.

2️⃣ Media Type in HTTP Response
The server uses the Content-Type header to tell the client what type of data it’s returning.
✅ Example:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "success",
  "id": 101
}
➡️ This tells the client that the response body is JSON.

3️⃣ Content Negotiation in REST APIs
In REST, the client can tell the server which format it accepts using the Accept header.
✅ Example:
GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
✔️ The client says: “I want the response in JSON.”
✔️ The server will then return data in JSON format (if supported).

➤ If the client instead says:
Accept: application/xml

➤ The server can respond with:
Content-Type: application/xml


4️⃣ Media Types in Spring Boot REST APIs
In Spring Boot, you can specify media types using:
➤ @RequestMapping, @PostMapping, @GetMapping etc.
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class UserController {

    @PostMapping(
        value = "/users",
        consumes = "application/json",     // Request body format 
        produces = "application/json"      // Response format
    )
    // can provide multiple values for the consumes and produces
    public ResponseEntity<User> addUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(user);
    }
}

✅ consumes ─────────▶ tells what type of input the API accepts
✅ produces ─────────▶ tells what type of output the API returns


⚡ Real-World Example
✅ Request:
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Accept: application/json

✅ Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{"message": "File uploaded successfully!"}


===================
🔷 API Versioning
===================
➤ API Versioning is a way to evolve your backend APIs without breaking existing clients (mobile apps, frontend, third-party consumers).
➤ When you change response fields, rename endpoints, change validation rules, etc. → old clients may crash.
➤ Versioning helps you support old + new clients together.


🔄 Why API Versioning is Needed?
✅ Real-world problems without versioning

If you change an API like:
🔗 Old: { "name": "Ankur" }
🔗 New: { "fullName": "Ankur Verma" }

Then:
➤ Old frontend still expects name
➤ It breaks immediately → production issue

✅ Versioning gives backward compatibility
So you can do:
➤ v1 clients keep using /api/v1/users
➤ v2 clients start using /api/v2/users
👉 Both run parallel.


🔄 What changes require versioning?
Versioning is needed when you do breaking changes, like:

🟠 Breaking changes (must version)
➤ Rename a field (name → fullName)
➤ Remove a field
➤ Change data type (age: "22" → age: 22)
➤ Change response structure
➤ Change endpoint semantics (meaning)
➤ Change authentication/authorization behavior
➤ Change pagination style (offset → cursor)

🟢 Non-breaking changes (no need to version)
➤ Adding a new optional field
➤ Adding a new endpoint
➤ Adding new query parameter (optional)


🔄 Types of API Versioning (Spring Boot supports all)
1️⃣ URI Versioning
✅ Example:
/api/v1/users
/api/v2/users

Pros
✅ Simple
✅ Visible
✅ Easy routing & debugging

Cons
❌ URL changes → not “pure REST” (but still industry standard)


2️⃣ Request Parameter Versioning
✅ Example:
/api/users?version=1
/api/users?version=2

Pros
✅ Same endpoint

Cons
❌ Harder caching
❌ Less readable
❌ Not popular in enterprise


3️⃣ Header Versioning
✅ Example:
X-API-VERSION: 1
X-API-VERSION: 2

Pros
✅ Clean URL
✅ Good for internal APIs

Cons
❌ Harder for browser testing
❌ Not visible easily


4️⃣ Media Type / Accept Header Versioning
✅ Example:
Accept: application/vnd.company.app-v1+json
Accept: application/vnd.company.app-v2+json

Pros
✅ Best REST purity
✅ Used by big companies sometimes

Cons
❌ Overkill for most apps
❌ Hard to maintain


🔄 Best Versioning Strategy (Recommended)
➤ For Spring Boot microservices + interview, best is: URI versioning
➤ Because it’s simplest, scalable, and common.


✅ Code Example:
We will create:
Book API v1
Book API v2
Same database/service layer
Different DTOs(response formats)


🔄 Project Structure
com.example.book
 ┣ controller
 ┃   ┣ v1
 ┃   ┃   ┗ BookControllerV1.java
 ┃   ┣ v2
 ┃   ┃   ┗ BookControllerV2.java
 ┣ dto
 ┃   ┣ v1
 ┃   ┃   ┗ BookResponseV1.java
 ┃   ┣ v2
 ┃   ┃   ┗ BookResponseV2.java
 ┣ service
 ┃   ┗ BookService.java
 ┣ entity
 ┃   ┗ Book.java
 ┗ repository
     ┗ BookRepository.java
👉 This is how real companies do it.


🔗 Entity + Repository (Common for all versions)
✅ Book.java
package com.example.book.entity;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import lombok.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "books")
@Getter
@Setter
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;
    private String author;
    private Double price;
}

✅ BookRepository.java
package com.example.book.repository;

import com.example.book.entity.Book;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface BookRepository extends JpaRepository<Book, Long> {
}

🔗 Service Layer (Common Business Logic)
✅ BookService.java
package com.example.book.service;

import com.example.book.entity.Book;
import com.example.book.repository.BookRepository;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.List;

@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class BookService {

    private final BookRepository bookRepository;

    public List<Book> getAllBooks() {
        return bookRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Book getBookById(Long id) {
        return bookRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Book not found with id: " + id));
    }
}

🔗 DTOs for Versioning
❓ Why DTOs matter in versioning?
Never return Entity directly because:
➤ you can’t safely evolve it
➤ changes will break clients
➤ So versioning is done mostly via DTO evolution.


🔗 DTO v1 (Simple response)
BookResponseV1.java
package com.example.book.dto.v1;

import lombok.*;

@Getter
@Setter
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
public class BookResponseV1 {
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String author;
}
👉 In v1 we are NOT sending price.


🔗 DTO v2 (Improved response)
BookResponseV2.java
package com.example.book.dto.v2;

import lombok.*;

@Getter
@Setter
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
public class BookResponseV2 {
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private Double price;
    private String category; // new field introduced in v2
}
👉 v2 adds price + category.


🔗 Controller Versioning (URI Versioning)
✅ BookController v1
/api/v1/books
package com.example.book.controller.v1;

import com.example.book.dto.v1.BookResponseV1;
import com.example.book.entity.Book;
import com.example.book.service.BookService;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/books")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class BookControllerV1 {

    private final BookService bookService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<BookResponseV1> getAllBooks() {
        return bookService.getAllBooks()
                .stream()
                .map(this::mapToV1)
                .toList();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public BookResponseV1 getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Book book = bookService.getBookById(id);
        return mapToV1(book);
    }

    private BookResponseV1 mapToV1(Book book) {
        return BookResponseV1.builder()
                .id(book.getId())
                .title(book.getTitle())
                .author(book.getAuthor())
                .build();
    }
}

🔗 BookController v2
/api/v2/books
package com.example.book.controller.v2;

import com.example.book.dto.v2.BookResponseV2;
import com.example.book.entity.Book;
import com.example.book.service.BookService;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v2/books")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class BookControllerV2 {

    private final BookService bookService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<BookResponseV2> getAllBooks() {
        return bookService.getAllBooks()
                .stream()
                .map(this::mapToV2)
                .toList();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public BookResponseV2 getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Book book = bookService.getBookById(id);
        return mapToV2(book);
    }

    private BookResponseV2 mapToV2(Book book) {
        return BookResponseV2.builder()
                .id(book.getId())
                .title(book.getTitle())
                .author(book.getAuthor())
                .price(book.getPrice())
                .category("Fiction") // dummy example
                .build();
    }
}


🔄 Testing in Postman / Browser
v1
🔗 GET: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/books
Response:[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Atomic Habits", "author": "James Clear" }
]

v2
🔗 GET: http://localhost:8080/api/v2/books
Response:[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Atomic Habits",
    "author": "James Clear",
    "price": 499.0,
    "category": "Fiction"
  }
]


🔄 Best Practices
1️⃣ Keep versions stable
➤ Once published, don’t break v1
➤ Add changes in v2


2️⃣ Deprecation strategy
➤ Mark v1 as deprecated
➤ Provide migration time
➤ Remove after months

✅Example:
@Deprecated
@GetMapping
public List<BookResponseV1> getAllBooks() { ... }


3️⃣ Use DTOs not Entities
➤ Entity is internal, DTO is public contract.


4️⃣ Don’t create too many versions
➤ Usually companies maintain:
    ✔️  current version
    ✔️  1 old version


🔄 Maintain version-specific documentation
Swagger/OpenAPI per version helps a lot.


🔄 Alternative: Header Versioning (Practical Example)
Controller with headers:
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/books")
public class BookHeaderVersionController {

    @GetMapping(headers = "X-API-VERSION=1")
    public String v1() {
        return "Books API v1";
    }

    @GetMapping(headers = "X-API-VERSION=2")
    public String v2() {
        return "Books API v2";
    }
}


=============================
🔷 REST API best practices
=============================
1️⃣ Use proper HTTP methods

2️⃣ Use clear & consistent resource-based URLs
✅ Good:
    ✔️ /api/v1/users
    ✔️ /api/v1/users/{id}
    ✔️ /api/v1/users/{id}/appointments

❌ Bad:
    ✔️ /getUsers
    ✔️ /createUserNow


3️⃣ Use correct HTTP status codes

4️⃣ Always validate input (server-side)
➤ Validate required fields
➤ Validate formats (email, phone)
➤ Validate ranges (age, salary)
➤ Reject extra/unknown fields if needed

5️⃣ Standardize your API response format
✅ Example:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "data": { }
}

For errors:
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [
    { "field": "email", "reason": "Invalid format" }
  ]
}

6️⃣ Version your APIs
➤ Use: /api/v1/...
➤ So future breaking changes go into: /api/v2/...

7️⃣ Secure the API properly
➤ Use HTTPS
➤ Use JWT / OAuth2
➤ Never expose sensitive fields (password, OTP)
➤ Store passwords with bcrypt
➤ Add role-based access control (Admin/Doctor/Patient)

8️⃣ Pagination, filtering, sorting for lists
Example:
    🔗 /users?page=1&limit=20
    🔗 /appointments?doctorId=12&status=CONFIRMED
    🔗 /users?sortBy=createdAt&order=desc

9️⃣ Avoid heavy payloads (optimize responses)
➤ Return only required fields
➤ Use DTOs (response models)
➤ Support query like: ?fields=id,name,email

1️⃣0️⃣ Handle errors globally (consistent)
Use global exception handling so all errors are clean + predictable.

1️⃣1️⃣ Use proper naming conventions
➤ JSON keys in camelCase
➤ Consistent field names: createdAt, updatedAt

1️⃣2️⃣ Make APIs idempotent where needed
➤ PUT should be idempotent (same request = same result)
➤ Avoid duplicate resource creation on retries

1️⃣3️⃣ Logging + Monitoring
➤ Log request id / user id
➤ Track failures (4xx/5xx)
➤ Use correlation IDs for debugging microservices

1️⃣4️⃣ Rate limiting + throttling
Protect from abuse: 100 requests/minute per user/IP

1️⃣5️⃣ Write good API documentation
Use:
    ✔️ Swagger / OpenAPI
    ✔️ Provide sample request/response


============================
🔷 Rest Client Development
============================
A REST Client is a tool, library, or component that allows you to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to a REST API and receive responses — typically used to test, consume, or interact with RESTful web services.

A REST Client acts as a consumer of REST APIs.
It sends HTTP requests to the server (REST API endpoint) and reads the HTTP responses returned.

In springboot we can develop REST Client using following ways:
1️⃣ Using RestTemplate (Synchrnous Communication: sending request and wating for response then processing other requests)
2️⃣ Using RestClient
3️⃣ Using WebClient (Synchrnous + Asynchrnous Communication)
4️⃣ Using FeignClient (Declarative REST Client)

✅ Example in Real Life
➤ When you use Postman, you’re using a REST Client application to test APIs.
➤ When a frontend app (React, Angular, Flutter) calls an API using fetch() or axios, those are REST Client libraries making HTTP calls.


==================
🔷 RestTemplate
==================
➤ RestTemplate is a class provided by Spring Framework that acts as a synchronous REST client.
➤ It allows your Spring application to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to consume REST APIs.
➤ Think of it as your Java-based Postman — but used inside your application code.


2️⃣ When to Use It
➤ You use RestTemplate when:
    ✔️ Your Spring app wants to call another REST API (either external or internal).
    ✔️ You need to integrate multiple microservices.
    ✔️ You want to send or receive JSON data programmatically


3️⃣ How It Works Internally
Here’s the internal flow: [Your Spring App] ─────────▶ (RestTemplate) ─────────▶ [HTTP Request] ─────────▶ [Target REST API] ─────────▶ [Response] ─────────▶ (RestTemplate parses it) ─────────▶ [Java Object or String]


✅ Example Flow:
You call:
restTemplate.getForObject("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", Post.class);
─────────▶ It makes a GET request to that URL
─────────▶ Gets the JSON response
─────────▶ Converts it automatically into a Post Java object using Jackson JSON Mapper

✅ Example: Let's say we have StudentService and a client Service that calls it.

🔗 StudentController.java (Server/API Provider)
package com.example.demo.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/students")
public class StudentController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Student getStudent(@PathVariable int id) {
        return new Student(id, "Ankur Verma", "IT");
    }
}

🔗 StudentService.java 
package com.example.demo.request;
@Data
class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
}


@Configuration
public class RestTemplateConfig {
    @Bean
    public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}


🔄 If we want to set timeouts
@Configuration
public class RestTemplateConfig {

@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory factory = new SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory();
    factory.setConnectTimeout(5000); // 5 seconds
    factory.setReadTimeout(5000);    // 5 seconds
    return new RestTemplate(factory);
    }
}


🔗 StudentClient.java (Consumer using RestTemplate)
package com.example.demo.client;

import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class StudentClient {

    private final RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    public void getStudentDetails() {
        String url = "http://localhost:8080/api/students/1";

        // Make GET request and receive response as Student object
        ResponseEntity<Student> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(url, Student.class);

        // Print response
        System.out.println("Status Code: " + response.getStatusCode());
        System.out.println("Student Details:");
        System.out.println("ID: " + response.getBody().getId());
        System.out.println("Name: " + response.getBody().getName());
        System.out.println("Department: " + response.getBody().getDepartment());
    }
}


// Student model (same structure as in API)
@Data
class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
}


🔄 Running the Example
➤ Run the StudentController application (port 8080).
─────────▶ It exposes an endpoint: GET http://localhost:8080/api/students/1

➤ Run StudentClient class (it can be in another app or in same app).
─────────▶ It makes a GET call using RestTemplate.


✅ You’ll see output like:
Status Code: 200 OK
Student Details:
ID: 1
Name: Ankur Verma
Department: IT


🔄 Commonly Used RestTemplate Methods
| Method                            | Purpose                                                  | Example                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getForObject(url, class)`        | GET request and returns object directly                  | `restTemplate.getForObject(url, Student.class)`           |
| `getForEntity(url, class)`        | GET request and returns `ResponseEntity` (status + body) | `restTemplate.getForEntity(url, Student.class)`           |
| `postForObject(url, body, class)` | POST request and returns created object                  | `restTemplate.postForObject(url, student, Student.class)` |
| `postForEntity(url, body, class)` | POST request returning full response                     | `restTemplate.postForEntity(url, student, Student.class)` |
| `put(url, body)`                  | PUT request (no return)                                  | `restTemplate.put(url, student)`                          |
| `delete(url)`                     | DELETE request                                           | `restTemplate.delete(url)`                                |


🔄 Limitations of RestTemplate 
1️⃣ There are so many overloaed methods which create confusion and so its hard to remember and maintain.
2️⃣ It was build before cocepts like Retry, circuit breaker etc. so adding support means more overloaded methods and not user friendly.
3️⃣ It is a blocking client which means each request will block the thread until response is received. This can lead to thread exhaustion under high load.


===============
🔷 RestClient
===============
➤ RestClient is a modern, synchronous (blocking) HTTP client
➤ Introduced in Spring Framework 6
➤ Designed as a replacement for RestTemplate
➤ Provides a fluent(chaining of methods), readable, and type-safe API
➤ Built on top of Spring’s HTTP infrastructure


🔄 Why Spring Introduced RestClient
Problems with RestTemplate
    ✔️ Old, imperative API
    ✔️ Verbose
    ✔️ Hard to customize
    ✔️ No future enhancements planned

Problems with WebClient
    ✔️ Reactive programming overhead
    ✔️ Mono / Flux learning curve
    ✔️ Overkill for simple MVC apps

Solution ─────────▶ RestClient
    ✔️ Blocking (simple mental model)
    ✔️ Fluent API
    ✔️ Future-proof
    ✔️ Clean error handling


🔄 Positioning in Spring REST Clients
RestTemplate   ❌ (legacy, blocking)
RestClient     ✅ (modern, blocking)
WebClient      ⚡ (reactive, non-blocking)
Feign          🧩 (declarative abstraction)


🔄 Core Characteristics
➤ Blocking I/O
➤ Synchronous request-response
➤ Fluent builder pattern
➤ Strong typing
➤ Integrated with Spring ecosystem
➤ Supports interceptors, error handlers, timeouts


🔄 Creating a RestClient
1️⃣ Simple Creation
@Bean
public RestClient restClient() {
        return RestClient.create();
}

2️⃣ Recommended (Bean Configuration)
@Bean
public RestClient restClient() {
    return RestClient.builder()
            .baseUrl("https://api.example.com")
            .defaultHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
            .build();
}
👉 Best practice: Define as a singleton bean


🔄 Basic HTTP Operations
✅ GET Request
User user = restClient
        .get()
        .uri("/users/{id}", 1)
        .retrieve()
        .body(User.class);


✅ POST Request
UserResponse response = restClient
        .post()
        .uri("/users")
        .body(userRequest)
        .retrieve()
        .body(UserResponse.class);


✅ PUT Request
restClient.put()
        .uri("/users/{id}", 1)
        .body(updateRequest)
        .retrieve()
        .toBodilessEntity();


✅ DELETE Request
restClient.delete()
        .uri("/users/{id}", 1)
        .retrieve()
        .toBodilessEntity();


🔄 Response Handling
─────────▶ Read Full Response
ResponseEntity<User> response =
        restClient.get()
        .uri("/users/{id}", 1)
        .retrieve()
        .toEntity(User.class);

─────────▶ No Response Body
restClient.post()
        .uri("/users")
        .body(request)
        .retrieve()
        .toBodilessEntity();


🔄 Error Handling
restClient.get()
    .uri("/users/{id}", 1)
    .retrieve()
    .onStatus(HttpStatusCode::is4xxClientError,
        (req, res) -> {
            throw new RuntimeException("Client error");
        })
    .onStatus(HttpStatusCode::is5xxServerError,
        (req, res) -> {
            throw new RuntimeException("Server error");
        })
    .body(User.class);

✅ Cleaner than RestTemplate exception handling


🔄 Headers & Authentication
Custom Headers
restClient.get()
    .uri("/users")
    .header("Authorization", "Bearer token")
    .retrieve()
    .body(List.class);

Default Headers (Global)
RestClient.builder()
    .defaultHeader("Authorization", "Bearer token")
    .build();


🔄 Path Variables & Query Params
1️⃣ Path Variables
.uri("/users/{id}", id)

2️⃣ Query Parameters
.uri(uriBuilder ->
    uriBuilder
        .path("/users")
        .queryParam("active", true)
        .build()
)


🔄 Interceptors (Cross-Cutting Concerns)
1️⃣ Inside the Builder
RestClient.builder()
    .requestInterceptor((request, body, execution) -> {
        System.out.println("Request URL: " + request.getURI());
        return execution.execute(request, body);
    })
    .build();
Use cases:
    ✔️ Logging
    ✔️ Authentication
    ✔️ Tracing
    ✔️ Metrics


2️⃣ Can create seperate Interceptor class
public class LoggingInterceptor implements ClientHttpRequestInterceptor {
    @Override
    public ClientHttpResponse intercept(
            HttpRequest request,
            byte[] body,
            ClientHttpRequestExecution execution) throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Request URL: " + request.getURI());
        return execution.execute(request, body);
    }
}

Then register it:
@Configuration
public class RestClientConfig {
    @Bean
    public RestClient restClientInstance() {
        return RestClient.builder()
                .interceptor(new LoggingInterceptor())
                .build();
    }
}


🔄 Timeouts & HTTP Client
RestClient uses:
➤ ClientHttpRequestFactory
➤ Backed by:
    ✔️ JDK HttpClient
    ✔️ Apache HttpClient
    ✔️ OkHttp

✅ Example:
HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory factory =
        new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory();

factory.setConnectTimeout(5000);
factory.setReadTimeout(5000);

RestClient.builder()
    .requestFactory(factory)
    .build();


🔄 RestClient vs RestTemplate
| Feature        | RestTemplate | RestClient |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| API Style      | Imperative   | Fluent     |
| Future Support | ❌            | ✅       |
| Error Handling | Weak         | Strong     |
| Configuration  | Hard         | Easy       |
| Spring Boot 3  | ❌            | ✅       |


==============
🔷 WebClient
==============
➤ WebClient is part of Spring WebFlux, a reactive web framework introduced in Spring 5.
➤ It is used to make asynchronous, non-blocking HTTP requests to REST APIs.

👉 Think of it as: A reactive, lightweight, and flexible version of RestTemplate


🔄 Why WebClient Was Introduced
➤ RestTemplate (older client) works in a blocking manner —that means each thread waits for the response before continuing.
➤ In contrast, WebClient is non-blocking — it can handle many requests concurrently with fewer threads, improving performance and scalability.


🔄 Key Features of WebCl
| Feature                  | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reactive (Non-blocking)  | Uses Project Reactor (`Mono` and `Flux`) for async programming.           |
| Lightweight              | Doesn’t depend on Servlet API. Works in both Spring MVC and WebFlux apps. |
| Supports Streaming       | Can handle continuous data streams (e.g., SSE, WebSockets).               |
| Functional API           | Fluent builder-style syntax for constructing requests.                    |
| Can Replace RestTemplate | Fully supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.                               |


🔄 When to Use WebClient
✔️ When building reactive or high-performance applications.
✔️ When handling multiple concurrent API calls.
✔️ When you need to stream data (e.g., continuous updates).
✔️ When you’re using Spring WebFlux or microservices.


🔄 Basic Syntax
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create("http://localhost:8080");

Mono<Student> studentMono = webClient.get()
    .uri("/api/students/1")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(Student.class);
Mono<Student> is a reactive type that represents one asynchronous result (like a Future<Student>).


🔄 WebClient vs RestTemplate
| Feature               | `RestTemplate`                  | `WebClient`                 |
| ----------------------| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Introduced In         | Spring 3                        | Spring 5 (WebFlux)          |
| Type                  | Synchronous (Blocking)          | Asynchronous (Non-blocking) |
| Performance           | Slower (one thread per request) | Faster (reactive model)     |
| Reactive Support      | ❌ No                            | ✅ Yes                    |
| Streaming Support     | ❌ No                            | ✅ Yes                    |
| Recommended By Spring | Deprecated (for new apps)       | ✅ Official Replacement     |


🔄 Maven dependency for WebClient:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>

➤ spring-boot-starter-web ─────────▶ class
➤ spring-boot-starter-webflux ─────────▶ interface


🔄 Reactive Concepts Used
1️⃣ Mono<T> ─────────▶ represents 0 or 1 asynchronous result (like one Student).
2️⃣ Flux<T> ─────────▶ represents 0 or many asynchronous results (like list of Students).

✅ Example:
Flux<Student> students = webClient.get()
    .uri("/api/students")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToFlux(Student.class);

🔄 Real-World Use Case Example
Let’s say you have a Student Service that needs to call another Course Service.

@Service
public class StudentService {

    private final WebClient webClient = WebClient.create("http://course-service:8081");

    public Mono<Course> getCourseDetails(int studentId) {
        return webClient.get()
                .uri("/api/courses/student/{id}", studentId)
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(Course.class);
    }
}
✅ Non-blocking, so the thread doesn’t wait for the response —
it can handle hundreds of concurrent API calls efficiently.


====================
🔷 Spring Data REST
====================
➤ Spring Data REST is a module of the Spring Data project that automatically exposes RESTful APIs for your Spring Data Repositories — without writing any controller code.
➤ If you already have a JpaRepository, Spring Data REST will automatically create REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for you.

🔄 How It Works
When you include the dependency spring-boot-starter-data-rest, Spring Boot:
➤ Scans your repositories (like StudentRepository).
➤ Automatically creates REST endpoints under /entities or your custom path.
➤ Converts Java entities to JSON responses.
➤ Handles CRUD operations and pagination by default.

🔄 What to Add while making project:
➤ Spring Data JPA
➤ Rest Repositories
➤ MySQL Driver

🔄 Dependency
👉 Add this dependency in your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</artifactId>
</dependency>
⚡ (You must also have spring-boot-starter-data-jpa and a database driver like mysql-connector-java.)

✅ Example: Exposing Student Repository as REST API
1️⃣ Entity Class
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.GenerationType;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String course;

    // getters and setters
}

2️⃣ Repository Interface
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource;

@RepositoryRestResource(path = "students")
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {
}
✅ The @RepositoryRestResource(path = "students") annotation tells Spring Data REST to expose this repository as a REST resource under /students.

3️⃣ Run the Application
When you start your Spring Boot app, Spring Data REST automatically generates endpoints like:
| HTTP Method | Endpoint     | Description                        |
| ----------- | -------------| ---------------------------------- |
| GET     | `/students`      | Get all students (with pagination) |
| GET     | `/students/{id}` | Get student by ID                  |
| POST    | `/students`      | Create a new student               |
| PUT     | `/students/{id}` | Update an existing student         |
| DELETE  | `/students/{id}` | Delete student by ID               |

✅ Example Request & Response
👉 POST Request:
POST /students
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "Ankur Verma",
  "course": "B.Tech IT"
}

👉 Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Ankur Verma",
  "course": "B.Tech IT"
}

🔄 Customization Options
| Annotation                               | Purpose                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@RepositoryRestResource`                | Customize path, collection name, and relation name.                   |
| `@RestResource`                          | Customize endpoint exposure for specific methods.                     |
| `@Projection`                            | Control what fields are shown in REST responses.                      |
| `@ExcerptProjection`                     | Show summarized data when listing entities.                           |
| `@HandleBeforeSave` / `@HandleAfterSave` | Add custom logic (like events) before or after repository operations. |


✅ Example of Customization
@RepositoryRestResource(collectionResourceRel = "learners", path = "students")
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {

    @RestResource(path = "byName", rel = "byName")
    List<Student> findByNameContaining(@Param("name") String name);
}
👉 Now you can access:
For findBy queries we have to add /search to the path, for example ─────────▶ eGET /students/search/byName?name=Ankur

🔄 Internals & Concepts
➤ Spring Data REST uses HAL (Hypertext Application Language) format by default for HATEOAS links.
➤ Uses Spring MVC under the hood, but you don’t need to write controllers.
➤ It’s built on Spring Data Repositories, so all query methods automatically become endpoints.

🔄 Advantages
✅ No need to write boilerplate controller code.
✅ Automatic CRUD and pagination.
✅ HATEOAS support for navigable APIs.
✅ Integrates easily with JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, etc.
✅ Easy to customize endpoints and data projections.

🔄 When Not to Use
➤ If your API requires complex business logic or custom response structures.
➤ If you need authentication, role-based access, or API versioning — then you’d better write custom controllers.

🔄 Goal
Restrict or disable specific HTTP methods (like POST, PUT, or DELETE) for certain entities when using Spring Data REST.

1️⃣ Create Configuration Class
You’ll use RepositoryRestConfigurer to customize repository exposure.

package com.example.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.RepositoryRestConfiguration;
import org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer;
import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;

import com.example.entity.Student;

@Configuration
public class RestRepositoryConfig implements RepositoryRestConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config) {

        // Disable HTTP methods for Student entity: PUT, POST, DELETE
        HttpMethod[] unsupportedActions = {HttpMethod.PUT, HttpMethod.POST, HttpMethod.DELETE};

        // Apply restrictions
        config.getExposureConfiguration()
                .forDomainType(Student.class)
                .withItemExposure((metadata, httpMethods) ->
                        httpMethods.disable(unsupportedActions))
                .withCollectionExposure((metadata, httpMethods) ->
                        httpMethods.disable(unsupportedActions));
    }
}


🔄 Apply Restrictions to Multiple Entities
You can restrict multiple repositories easily:

config.getExposureConfiguration()
        .forDomainType(Student.class)
        .withItemExposure((metadata, httpMethods) -> httpMethods.disable(unsupportedActions))
        .withCollectionExposure((metadata, httpMethods) -> httpMethods.disable(unsupportedActions));

config.getExposureConfiguration()
        .forDomainType(Course.class)
        .withItemExposure((metadata, httpMethods) -> httpMethods.disable(unsupportedActions))
        .withCollectionExposure((metadata, httpMethods) -> httpMethods.disable(unsupportedActions));

🔄 Optional — Expose Entity IDs in JSON
By default, Spring Data REST hides entity IDs.
You can expose them in the same config class:

config.exposeIdsFor(Student.class);


=========================================================
🔷 MongoTemplate, Criteria, and Query in Spring Boot
==========================================================
➤ MongoTemplate is a core class in Spring Data MongoDB that provides:
    ✔️ Fine-grained control over queries,
    ✔️ Custom query building (beyond @Query or repository methods),
    ✔️ Access to MongoDB’s full query and aggregation power.
👉 It’s similar to how JdbcTemplate works for relational databases.

✅ Example:
  @Autowired
    private MongoTemplate mongoTemplate;

    public List<User> getUserForSentimentAnalysis() {
        Query query = new Query();
        query.addCriteria(Criteria.where("userName").is("Ram"));
        return mongoTemplate.find(query, User.class);

    }

➤ MongoTemplate is auto-configured by Spring Boot if MongoDB connection details exist in application.properties.
➤ Using @Autowired injects the template, allowing you to directly interact with the MongoDB database.

Query query = new Query();
👉 Creates a blank query object that can be configured with filters, sort, projection, etc.

query.addCriteria(Criteria.where("userName").is("Ram"));
👉 Builds a filter condition using Criteria.

This is equivalent to MongoDB’s JSON query:
{ "userName": "Ram" }
👉 You can chain multiple criteria using .and(), .orOperator(), .gt(), etc.

return mongoTemplate.find(query, User.class);
➤ Executes the query on the User collection (Spring automatically maps the class to the MongoDB collection).
➤ Converts each matching MongoDB document into a User Java object.
➤ Returns a List<User>

✅ Extended Examples: Find by multiple fields:
Query query = new Query();
query.addCriteria(Criteria.where("userName").is("Ram").and("age").gte(25));
List<User> users = mongoTemplate.find(query, User.class);

✅ Example: Using OR condition
Query query = new Query();
query.addCriteria(new Criteria().orOperator(
    Criteria.where("userName").is("Ram"),
    Criteria.where("email").is("ram@ram")
));
List<User> users = mongoTemplate.find(query, User.class);

❓ Why Use MongoTemplate Instead of MongoRepository?
| Use Case                                        | Prefer            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Simple CRUD, auto queries                       | `MongoRepository` |
| Complex filters, dynamic criteria, aggregations | `MongoTemplate`   |


================================
🔷 REST API Exception handling
================================
In springboot we can handle exception in 2 ways:
| Type                     | Description                                                             | Scope               |
| -------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------- |
| Global Exception Handler | Handles exceptions across all controllers using `@RestControllerAdvice` | Application-wide    |
| Local Exception Handler  | Handles exceptions within a single controller using `@ExceptionHandler` | Controller-specific |

🔄 Steps:
➤ Create User Defined Exception class
➤ Create ExceptionInfo binding class
➤ Create Rest Controller Advice to handle global exceptions in our application.

Step 1️⃣ Create User-Defined Exception Class
This is your custom business exception — for example, when a student is not found.

package com.example.exception;

public class StudentNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public StudentNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

2️⃣ Create ExceptionInfo (Response Model) Class
This class represents the structure of the error response returned to the client.

package com.example.exception;

import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;

@AllArgsConstructor
@Data
public class ExceptionInfo {
    private String message;
    private String path;
    private LocalDateTime timestamp;
    private String errorCode;
    
}

🌐 3️⃣ Global Exception Handler — @RestControllerAdvice
This handles exceptions for the entire Spring Boot application.
package com.example.exception;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest;

@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    // Handle specific exception
    @ExceptionHandler(StudentNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ExceptionInfo> handleStudentNotFound(StudentNotFoundException ex, WebRequest request) {
        ExceptionInfo info = new ExceptionInfo(
                ex.getMessage(),
                request.getDescription(false),
                "STUDENT_NOT_FOUND"
        );
        return new ResponseEntity<>(info, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }

    // Handle all other exceptions (fallback)
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ExceptionInfo> handleGeneralException(Exception ex, WebRequest request) {
        ExceptionInfo info = new ExceptionInfo(
                ex.getMessage(),
                request.getDescription(false),
                "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR"
        );
        return new ResponseEntity<>(info, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
👉 What Happens Here:
➤ Whenever StudentNotFoundException is thrown in any controller, this advice class catches it.
➤ It returns a JSON response with details like timestamp, error message, and URL


🔄 Local Exception Handler (Controller-Specific)
This handles exceptions inside a specific controller only.

package com.example.controller;

import com.example.exception.StudentNotFoundException;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/students")
public class StudentController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getStudent(@PathVariable int id) {
        if (id != 1) {
            throw new StudentNotFoundException("Student with ID " + id + " not found!");
        }
        return "Student Found: Ankur";
    }

    // Local handler — only works inside this controller
    @ExceptionHandler(StudentNotFoundException.class)
    public String handleLocalException(StudentNotFoundException ex) {
        return "⚠ Local Handler: " + ex.getMessage();
    }
}
👉 What Happens:
✔️ When /api/students/5 is called, it throws StudentNotFoundException.
✔️ The local exception handler catches it first (if available).
✔️ If not defined locally, then the global handler catches it.

5️⃣ Sample JSON Response (From Global Handler)
{
  "message": "Student with ID 10 not found!",
  "path": "uri=/api/students/10",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-04T15:12:40.305",
  "errorCode": "STUDENT_NOT_FOUND"
}


🔷 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN @ControllerAdvice AND @RestControllerAdvice
Annotation              | Description / Behavior
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ControllerAdvice        | Used to handle exceptions globally across controllers.
                         | Returns a view name (HTML/JSP) by default.
                         | Typically used in web MVC applications (non-REST).
                         | Must use @ResponseBody on methods to return JSON.
                         | Combines well with @ExceptionHandler, @ModelAttribute, etc.
                         | Example: returns "error-page" view template.

@RestControllerAdvice    | Introduced as a specialized version of @ControllerAdvice.
                         | It combines @ControllerAdvice + @ResponseBody.
                         | All handler methods return JSON or XML automatically.
                         | Ideal for REST APIs (Spring Boot RESTful services).
                         | No need to explicitly add @ResponseBody on methods.
                         | Example: returns JSON error response instead of a view.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Example 1 — Using @ControllerAdvice (Web MVC)
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ModelAndView handleException(Exception ex) {
        ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("error");
        mav.addObject("message", ex.getMessage());
        return mav;
    }
}
🔄 Explanation:
➤ Used in normal Spring MVC web apps.
➤ Returns a view page (e.g., error.html or error.jsp).
➤ If you want JSON, you must manually add @ResponseBody to the method.


✅ Example 2 — Using @RestControllerAdvice (REST API)
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalRestExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> handleAll(Exception ex) {
        Map<String, String> error = new HashMap<>();
        error.put("error", ex.getMessage());
        error.put("status", "500");
        return ResponseEntity.status(500).body(error);
    }
}
🔄 Explanation:
➤ Used for REST controllers.
➤ Automatically converts return values to JSON (no need for @ResponseBody).
➤ Cleaner and preferred for Spring Boot RESTful APIs.


================================================================
🔷 REST(Representation State Transfer) Architecture Principles
================================================================
1️⃣ Client-Server Architecture
➤ Separation of concerns between client (frontend/UI) and server (backend).
➤ Client handles UI and user interaction; server handles data storage and logic.
➤ Enables scalability, modularity, and independent development.


2️⃣ Statelessness
➤ Each request from client to server must contain all required information.
➤ Server does not store any client session data.
➤ Improves reliability and scalability since each request is independent.


3️⃣ Cacheability
➤ Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
➤ Reduces client-server interactions, improves performance.
✅ Example: HTTP headers like Cache-Control, ETag.


4️⃣ Uniform Interface
➤ Common standard way to communicate between client and server.
➤ Core of REST design — ensures simplicity and decoupling.
➤ Includes:
    ✔️ Resource Identification (using URIs)
    ✔️ Manipulation of Resources through representations (JSON/XML)
    ✔️ Self-descriptive messages (metadata in headers)
    ✔️ HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)

5️⃣ Layered System
➤ Architecture composed of hierarchical layers (client, API gateway, server, DB).
➤ Each layer has a specific function and does not need to know others’ details.
➤ Improves scalability and security through load balancers, proxies, etc.

6️⃣ Code-on-Demand (Optional)
➤ Allows server to send executable code (like JavaScript) to client for execution.
➤ Adds flexibility, but rarely used due to security concerns.


===========================================================
🔷 HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)
===========================================================
➤ HATEOAS is a REST principle that allows a client to dynamically navigate a REST API using hyperlinks provided in the responses.
➤ It means that each response from the server includes links (URLs) to related actions or resources — guiding the client on what can be done next.

2️⃣ Purpose
➤ Makes REST APIs more discoverable and self-descriptive.
➤ Client does not need hard-coded knowledge of API routes.
➤ Reduces coupling between client and server.
➤ Enables API evolution without breaking clients.

✅ Example
   ➤ Without HATEOAS:
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "Ankur",
         "department": "IT"
       }

   ➤ With HATEOAS:
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "Ankur",
         "department": "IT",
         "_links": {
           "self": { "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/students/1" },
           "all_students": { "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/students" },
           "update": { "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/students/1" },
           "delete": { "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/students/1" }
         }
       }
🔗 _links.self ─────────▶ shows the current resource link
🔗 _links.update ─────────▶ tells where to send a PUT request to update
🔗 _links.delete ─────────▶ tells where to send a DELETE request
🔗 _links.all-students ─────────▶ provides link to fetch all students


4️⃣ Key Components
➤ Resource Representation ─────────▶ The actual data (like student details).
➤ Hypermedia Links ─────────▶ Embedded links to related resources/actions.
➤ Relation Types ─────────▶ Describe purpose of each link (self, update, delete, etc.)

5️⃣ Implementation In Spring Boot
➤ Spring provides support via `spring-hateoas` library.
➤ You can use classes like:
         ✔️ EntityModel<T> : wraps a resource and adds links.
         ✔️ WebMvcLinkBuilder : used to build links to controller methods.

✅ Example:
         Student student = new Student(1, "Ankur");
         EntityModel<Student> model = EntityModel.of(student);
         model.add(linkTo(methodOn(StudentController.class)
             .getStudentById(1)).withSelfRel());
         model.add(linkTo(methodOn(StudentController.class)
             .getAllStudents()).withRel("all_students"));


🔄 Benefits of HATEOAS
1️⃣ Discoverability
➤ Clients can discover available actions dynamically through links in the response.
➤ No need for clients to hardcode URLs — they just follow links provided by the server.

2️⃣ Reduced Coupling
➤ Client and server are loosely coupled.
➤ If server endpoints change, clients still work as long as links in responses are updated.
➤ Makes APIs easier to evolve without breaking old clients.

3️⃣ Self-Descriptive APIs
➤ Each response contains both data and the available next actions.
➤ Clients can understand what to do next without additional documentation.

4️⃣ Easier Navigation
➤ Just like browsing a website, the client navigates the API using provided links.
➤ Example: From a student resource, client can directly get links to update or delete that student.

5️⃣ Better Maintainability
➤ Since clients depend on links, not hardcoded URIs, server changes cause minimal impact.
➤ Makes long-term maintenance and versioning simpler.

6️⃣ Improved Usability
➤ Helps build intelligent clients that can automatically discover and consume new features.
➤ Especially useful for large-scale or evolving APIs.

✅ Example JSON Response
When you hit
👉 GET http://localhost:8080/students/1

You’ll get this:

{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ankur",
    "course": "Java",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/students/1"
        },
        "all-students": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/students"
        }
    }
}

🔄 What Happened Here
➤ EntityModel<Student> wraps your Student object.
➤ _links section shows possible navigation options (self, all-students).
➤ Client doesn’t need to know URL structure — it just follows these links.

🔷 Logging in Spring Boot: SLF4J
==================================
➤ Logging is an essential aspect of the application development that allows developers to monitor and troubleshoot their applications.
➤ Spring Boot supports various logging frameworks, such as Logback, Log4J2, and Java Util Logging (JUL) out of the box.

🔄 Understanding frameworks:
1️⃣ Logback: A popular logging framework that serves as default in many SpringBoot applications. It offers a flexible configuration and good performance.
2️⃣ Log4J2: A logging framework similar to Logback with features such as asynchronous logging and support various output formats.
3️⃣ Java Util Logging (JUL): A logging framework that is a part of the Java platform. While it's less feature rich than some third-party frameworks, it is straightforward to use.

4️⃣ Log Monitoring Tools
1. Putty -- CLI tool
2. WinScp -- GUI tool
   ➤ Using WinScp we can upload and download files from windows to linux or vice versa using the file explorer.
3. ELK -- GUI tool
    ➤ E = Elasticsearch, L = Logstash, K = Kibana
4. Splunk(Licensed) -- GUI tool

🔄 How to Connect to Putty
1️⃣ Open Putty CLI in your machine
2️⃣ Enter the IP address of your server
4️⃣ Enter the port number
5️⃣ Enter the username
6️⃣ Enter the password
7️⃣ Connect
 
Enter the keypair file in Auth --> Credentials and enter the username and password for authentication on linux server and access the log file.

✔️ Spring Boot uses Logback as the default logging framework provides a good balance between simplicity and performance.
✔️ The default configuration is embedded within the Spring Boot libraries, and it may not be visible in your application's source code.
✔️ If you want to customize the logging configuration, you can create your own logback-spring.xml or logback.xml file in the src/main/resources directory.
✔️ When SpringBoot detects this file in your project, it will use it instead of the default configuration.

🔄 Logging Levels
Spring Boot supports the following logging levels:
| Level     | Description             | Example                |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| TRACE     | Detailed debugging info | Fine-grained flow logs |
| DEBUG     | Useful for debugging    | Dev-time logs          |
| INFO      | General app flow        | Startup, shutdown      |
| WARN      | Potential issues        | Deprecated method used |
| ERROR     | Errors & exceptions     | DB connection failed   |
| OFF       | Turns off logging       | —                      |

We can set the desired logging levels for specific packages or classes, allowing them to control the amount of information logged at runtime.

Spring Boot provides annotations like @Slf4j and @Log4j2 to help with logging, that can be used to automatically inject logger instance


🔷 SLF4J
➤ SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) is a logging abstraction layer.
➤ It provides a common interface for various logging frameworks (Logback, Log4j2, JUL, etc.).
➤ Spring Boot internally uses SLF4J + Logback by default.
➤ Think of SLF4J as a “universal adapter” that lets you switch logging backends easily without changing your application code.

❓ Why Use SLF4J
➤ Abstraction layer ─────────▶ decouples logging framework from code.
➤ Better performance ─────────▶ lazy evaluation of log messages ({} placeholders).
➤ Integration ─────────▶ widely supported in Spring, Hibernate, etc.
➤ Flexibility ─────────▶ easily switch from Logback ─────────▶ Log4j2 without code changes.

❓ How Logging Works in Spring Boot
➤ By default SLF4J API is used in code.
➤ Logback is the underlying implementation.
➤ Configurations are auto-loaded from:
  ✔️ application.properties or
  ✔️ logback-spring.xml

✅Example:
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class UserService {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);

    public void createUser(String name) {
        logger.info("Creating user: {}", name); 
        logger.debug("Debug info while creating user");
        logger.warn("This is a warning message");
        logger.error("Error occurred while creating user");
    }
}
✅ Output:
Creating user: Mike
Debug info while creating user
This is a warning message
Error occurred while creating user

🧠 Why {} ?
Because SLF4J supports parameterized logging — efficient and avoids string concatenation.

👉 We have to write:
 private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);
 to use this line of code for every class for logging in Spring Boot.
 ⚡ We have to write log instead of logger in the code as well

 instead of this we can use:
 @Slf4j // annotation provided by lambok library
 @Service
 public class UserService {
     public void createUser(String name) {
         log.info("Creating user: {}", name);
         log.debug("Debug info while creating user");
         log.warn("This is a warning message");
         log.error("Error occurred while creating user");
     }
 }

🔄 Configure Logging in application.properties

🔗 Code Example:
# Root logging level
logging.level.root=INFO 
👉 this gives logs for all packages and classes of level info or severe than info i.e trace and debug will never get printed.

# Package-specific level
logging.level.net.engineeringdigest.journalApp=DEBUG

# Log file output
logging.file.name=app.log
logging.file.path=logs/

# Pattern for console output
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n

🔄 Logging with Profiles
You can set different logging levels for each Spring profile:

🔗 Code Example:
# application-dev.properties
logging.level.root=DEBUG

# application-prod.properties
logging.level.root=ERROR

And activate profile:
spring.profiles.active=dev

🔄  Access Logs in Code
You can print the active profile in your logs:

🔗 Code Example:
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

@Autowired
private Environment env;

@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    String activeProfile = env.getActiveProfiles()[0];
    logger.info("Active profile: {}", activeProfile);
}

🔄 Logback Architecture (Default in Spring Boot)
🔗 Logger ─────────▶ Appender ─────────▶ Layout ─────────▶ Destination

➤ Logger ─────────▶ The entry point in your code (LoggerFactory.getLogger(...))
➤ Appender ─────────▶ Defines where to send logs (console, file, socket)
➤ Layout / Encoder ─────────▶ Defines how the log message looks
➤ Destination ─────────▶ Final output (file, stdout,+ Database etc.)

🔄 Configure in logback-spring.xml (Advanced)
When we have application.properties, we should use logback-spring.xml for logging configuration specifically.

🔗 Code Example:
<configuration>

👉 Console Appender
    <appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder> // encoder is a formatter for the output
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

👉 File appender
    <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
        <file>PAth_of_the_file</file>
    </appender>
👉  Database appender use jdbcAppender

👉 Set the root level and attach the console appender
    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/>
        <appender-ref ref="FILE"/>
    </root>

👉 Set the log level for a specific package or classes
    <logger name="net.engineeringdigest.journalApp" level="DEBUG"/>

</configuration>

Understanding structure:
1️⃣ <configuration>
<!-- Appender and Logger configuration go here -->
</configuration>
➤ The <configuration> elements is the root element of the logback.xml file. All logback configuration is enclosed within this element.

🔄 Patter Syntax:
  ✔️ %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - date and time
  ✔️ [%thread] - thread name
  ✔️ %-5level - logging level(left justified text with atmost 5 characters)
  ✔️ %logger{36} - logger name upto 36 characters
  ✔️ %msg  %n - message and new line

🔄 Rolling FileAppender Based on Time
✅Example:

<configuration>
    <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
        <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
            <fileNamePattern>logs/application-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</fileNamePattern>
            <maxHistory>10</maxHistory>
        </rollingPolicy>
    </appender>
</configuration>


🔄 Rolling FileAppender Based on Size of File
✅Example:
<configuration>
    <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
        <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedRollingPolicy">
            <maxFileSize>10MB</maxFileSize>
            <maxHistory>10</maxHistory>
        </rollingPolicy>
    </appender>
</configuration>
👉 Rolling based of size and time can be used at the same time whatever happens first will make logs accordingly.

🔷 SpringBoot Acuators
========================
Spring Boot Actuator is a module provided by Spring Boot that adds production-ready features to your application.
It allows you to monitor and manage your application by exposing endpoints that provide insights into:
✔️ Application health
✔️ Metrics (like memory usage, HTTP requests, database status)
✔️ Environment properties
✔️ Logging levels
✔️ Thread dumps
👉 Actuators help you observe and manage your Spring Boot application in production or development without writing additional monitoring code.


⚡ Key Features of Actuator
1️⃣ Health Checks
✔️ /actuator/health endpoint tells whether the application is up or down.
✔️ Can include custom checks (database connection, disk space, etc.).

2️⃣ Metrics
✔️ /actuator/metrics endpoint shows JVM stats, HTTP requests, memory usage, garbage collection, etc.
✔️ Useful for performance monitoring.

3️⃣ Environment Info
/actuator/env endpoint shows environment variables, system properties, and application configuration properties.

4️⃣ Application Info
/actuator/info endpoint allows you to add custom metadata like version, description, or author.

5️⃣ Loggers
/actuator/loggers endpoint lets you view and modify logging levels at runtime.

6️⃣ Thread Dumps
/actuator/threaddump provides a thread dump of the JVM for debugging purposes.

7️⃣ HTTP Tracing
Tracks recent HTTP requests and responses.

8️⃣ Integration with Monitoring Tools
Works with Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, or Spring Boot Admin for full monitoring dashboards.
✔️ All these actuators endpoints are predefined and they are binded to HTTP GET requests.
✔️ In Actuator we have a special endpoint called /shutdown which is used to shutdown the application.
✔️ This endpoint is binded to HTTP POST requests.


🔄 Why Use Spring Boot Actuator❓
1️⃣ Production-Ready Monitoring
Helps detect problems early in production.

2️⃣ Simplifies Maintenance
No need to manually write monitoring code for common checks.

3️⃣ Customizable
You can add your own health indicators, metrics, and info details.

4️⃣ Secure
Endpoints can be restricted using Spring Security.


🔄 How to Add Actuator to a Spring Boot Project
1️⃣ Add Dependency in pom.xml:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

2️⃣ Configure Endpoints (Optional)
By default, only a few endpoints are exposed (/health and /info).
You can expose more endpoints in application.properties or application.yml:

# Expose all actuator endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

# Exclude health endpoint
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=health

# Customize server port for actuator
management.server.port=8081

# Show detailed info in health endpoint
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always

# Enable shutdown endpoint
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true


3️⃣ Access Actuator Endpoints
| Endpoint               | Purpose                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `/actuator/health`     | Shows application health status |
| `/actuator/info`       | Shows custom app info           |
| `/actuator/metrics`    | Shows JVM and HTTP metrics      |
| `/actuator/env`        | Shows environment properties    |
| `/actuator/loggers`    | View/change log levels          |
| `/actuator/threaddump` | Thread dump of JVM              |
| `/actuator/httptrace`  | Recent HTTP requests            |


4️⃣ Customizing Health Indicator
You can create a custom health check by implementing HealthIndicator:
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.Health;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.HealthIndicator;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class DatabaseHealthCheck implements HealthIndicator {

    @Override
    public Health health() {
        // Imagine checking database connection
        boolean dbUp = checkDatabaseConnection();
        if (dbUp) {
            return Health.up().withDetail("Database", "Available").build();
        } else {
            return Health.down().withDetail("Database", "Not Available").build();
        }
    }

    private boolean checkDatabaseConnection() {
        // Logic to check DB connectivity
        return true;
    }
}
Now, when you hit /actuator/health, it will show something like:
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "db": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "database": "MySQL",
        "validationQuery": "isValid()"
      }
    },
    "diskSpace": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "total": 131071995904,
        "free": 104784420864,
        "threshold": 10485760,
        "path": "D:\\Microservices_practice\\.",
        "exists": true
      }
    },
    "ping": {
      "status": "UP"
    },
    "ssl": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "validChains": [],
        "invalidChains": []
      }
    }
  }
}


5️⃣ Security Consideration
➤ Actuator endpoints are sensitive (they expose internal info).
➤ Secure them using Spring Security:

# Require authentication for all actuator endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

# Require authentication for health endpoint 
management.endpoint.health.show-details=when-authorized 
👉 without adding security when we access /actuator/health we will only:
{
    status: "UP"
}
