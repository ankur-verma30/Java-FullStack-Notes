🔷 1️⃣ Parking Lot System
===========================
Design an in-memory backend for a single-floor parking lot that can:
➤ Park vehicles
➤ Unpark vehicles
➤ Track available slots
➤ Generate parking tickets
➤ No UI, no database, no threads.

🏗️ System Description
➤ The parking lot has a fixed number of parking slots.
➤ Each slot can hold only one vehicle and has a size constraint.
➤ Vehicle Types
    ✔️ Bike
    ✔️ Car
    ✔️ Truck
Each vehicle type requires a minimum slot size.
