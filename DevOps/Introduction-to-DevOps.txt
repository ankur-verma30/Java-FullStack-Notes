🔷 DevOps
DevOps (Development + Operations) is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to:
➤ Increase software delivery speed using Automation
➤ Improve product quality
➤ Enable continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
➤ Continuous Monitoring and logging
➤ Continuous Testing
DevOps is a culture and process that helps teams build, test, and release software faster and more reliably through automation and collaboration.

🔷 Why Devops?
Because it solves the traditional gap between developers and operations teams.

🔑 Key Reasons:
✔️ Faster Delivery: Automates build, test, and deployment → delivers updates quickly.
✔️ Better Collaboration: Breaks silos between dev & ops → teams work together efficiently.
✔️ Higher Quality: Continuous testing & monitoring → fewer bugs in production.
✔️ Scalability: Easier to handle large, complex systems through automation tools.
✔️ Reliability: Continuous integration and deployment ensure stable, consistent releases.
✔️ Quick Recovery: Issues are detected and fixed faster with monitoring and rollback features.
✔️ Customer Satisfaction: Frequent updates and faster fixes → happier users.


🔷 Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC) 
SDLC is the process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software systematically and efficiently.

🧩 Phases of SDLC:
✔️ Requirement Analysis(Planning and Defining)
➤ Understand what the client/user needs.
➤ Gather and docu ment functional & non-functional requirements.
➤ Output: Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

✔️ System Design
➤ Plan architecture, database, UI, and technology stack.
➤ Output: Design Documents, Wireframes

⚡ DevOps Centric Phases
✔️ Implementation (Coding)
➤ Developers write code based on the design.
➤ Follow coding standards and version control.

✔️ Testing
➤ Verify that the software works correctly and meets requirements.
➤ Includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

✔️ Deployment
➤ Release the software to production (end users).
➤ Can be manual or automated (DevOps CI/CD).

✔️ Maintenance
➤ Fix bugs, update features, and ensure system reliability.

🔁 Popular SDLC Models:
➤ Waterfall Model: Linear, phase-by-phase.
➤ Agile Model: Iterative and flexible.
➤ Spiral Model: Combines design + prototyping.
➤ V-Model: Verification and validation in parallel.


🔷 Roles in Company

✔️ Product Manager: Defines the vision, goals, and priorities
✔️ Product Owner: Manages baclong and converts vision into actionable stories

✔️ Security Engineer: Ensures product and infrasturcture security.
✔️ QA Engineer: Tests product quality and performance.
✔️ DevOps Engineer: Builds CI/CD pipelines and manages environments.
✔️ Release Manager: Plans and manages releases.
✔️ SRE: Ensures uptime, performance, and reliability post-release.
✔️ Technical Writer: Creates documentation for users and developers.

🔷 Virtual Machines (VM)
➤ A Virtual Machine is a software-based computer that runs inside another physical computer.
➤ It behaves just like a real machine (has its own CPU, memory, disk, OS), but it's virtual — created using virtualization software.
➤ A VM is like a computer inside a computer.

🌐 What is a Server?
A server is a computer that provides resources or services (like websites, databases, or files) to other computers (called clients) over a network.

✅ Example:
✔️ A web server hosts websites.
✔️ A database server stores and manages data.

⚙️ Physical vs Virtual Servers
| Feature            | **Physical Server**                      | **Virtual Server (VM)**                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Actual hardware machine                  | Software-based machine running on a physical host              |
| **Resource Usage** | Dedicated (not shared)                   | Shared among multiple VMs                                      |
| **Scalability**    | Difficult (requires new hardware)        | Easy (create new VMs quickly)                                  |
| **Cost**           | Expensive                                | Cost-effective                                                 |
| **Isolation**      | One OS per server                        | Multiple OSs can run on one physical machine                   |
| **Example**        | A Dell PowerEdge server in a data center | Several Ubuntu/Windows VMs running inside VMware or VirtualBox |


🔄 Hypervisor
A Hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines by sharing physical resources (CPU, RAM, disk) between them. 
🧩 Types of Hypervisors:
👉 Type 1 – Bare Metal Hypervisor:
➤ Runs directly on hardware (no host OS).
✅ Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM

👉 Type 2 – Hosted Hypervisor:
➤ Runs on top of a host OS (like an app).
✅ Examples: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation

🌍 Real-World Examples:
✔️ Cloud Providers:
➤  AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, Azure VMs — all use virtualization to create VMs on demand.

✔️ Development & Testing:
➤  Developers use VMs to test software in multiple OS environments.

✔️ Server Consolidation:
➤  Companies run multiple VMs (web server, DB server, mail server) on a single physical server to save costs.


❓ How to Automate the creation of Virtual Machines on any Cloud Platform using API?
Automation means you don’t manually click buttons to create a VM — instead, you use scripts or tools to create and manage VMs automatically.

1️⃣ AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)
➤ A command-line tool to interact directly with AWS services.
➤ Executes imperative commands (step-by-step actions).

✅ Example:
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0abcdef --instance-type t2.micro

🔄 Use case:
➤ Quick manual automation or scripting.
➤ Good for ad-hoc tasks, like creating or stopping instances.
⚙️ Level: Low-level (manual commands)

2️⃣ AWS SDK / API
➤ Programmatic access to AWS services using code.
➤ Available for languages like Python (Boto3), JavaScript, Java, etc.

✅ Example (Python Boto3):
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
ec2.run_instances(ImageId='ami-0abcdef', InstanceType='t2.micro', MinCount=1, MaxCount=1)

🔄 Use case:
➤ When you want to integrate AWS operations inside an app or custom automation scripts.
⚙️ Level: Low-level (programmatic control)

3️⃣ AWS CloudFormation (CFT)
➤ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool native to AWS.
➤ Uses YAML/JSON templates to define and deploy AWS resources.

✅ Example (YAML):
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0abcdef
      InstanceType: t2.micro

🔄 Use case:
➤ Automate AWS infrastructure provisioning in a declarative way.
➤ Used for repeatable deployments (same infra across environments).
⚙️ Level: Declarative IaC (AWS-only)

4️⃣ Terraform
➤ Multi-cloud Infrastructure as Code tool by HashiCorp.
➤ Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
➤ Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

✅ Example (HCL):
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

🔄 Use case:
➤ Cross-cloud automation
➤ Version-controlled infrastructure
➤ More flexible than CloudFormation (modular, reusable, portable).
⚙️ Level: Declarative IaC (multi-cloud)

💡 5️⃣ AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
➤ High-level Infrastructure as Code using real programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.)
➤ Converts your code → CloudFormation under the hood.

✅ Example (TypeScript):
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import { Stack } from 'aws-cdk-lib';

class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope, id, props) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    new ec2.Instance(this, 'MyInstance', {
      instanceType: new ec2.InstanceType('t2.micro'),
      machineImage: ec2.MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux(),
    });
  }
}

🔄 Use case:
➤ Developers who prefer real code over YAML.
➤ Allows loops, conditions, functions in infra definitions.
⚙️ Level: High-level IaC (code-driven)

| ------------------------ | --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **AWS CLI**              | Command line    | AWS only    | Shell            | Imperative               | Quick manual automation      |
| **AWS SDK/API**          | Programming API | AWS only    | Python, JS, etc. | Imperative               | Embed AWS ops in code        |
| **CloudFormation (CFT)** | IaC             | AWS only    | YAML/JSON        | Declarative              | AWS-native infra automation  |
| **Terraform**            | IaC             | Multi-cloud | HCL              | Declarative              | Cross-cloud infra automation |
| **AWS CDK**              | IaC             | AWS only    | Python/TS/Java   | Declarative (code-based) | Code-native infra definition |
