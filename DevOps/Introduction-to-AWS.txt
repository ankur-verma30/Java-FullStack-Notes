🔷 Introduction to AWS
#########################
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, storage, networking, databases, and services over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

🔄 Key characteristics
➤ On-demand self-service → no manual provisioning
➤ Broad network access → accessible over internet
➤ Resource pooling → shared infrastructure (multi-tenant)
➤ Rapid elasticity → scale up/down instantly
➤ Measured service → pay only for what you use

👉 Cloud is a model that allows us to rent IT resources instead of owning physical infrastructure, improving scalability, cost efficiency, and speed.

🔷 AWS IAM
#############
➤ AWS IAM is a global AWS service used to manage users, permissions, and access to AWS resources securely.
➤ IAM allows us to control who can access AWS, what actions they can perform, and on which resources.

🔄 Why IAM is Needed?
🌟 Without IAM:
    ✔️ Everyone uses root account ❌
    ✔️ No permission boundaries ❌
    ✔️ High risk of data breach ❌

🌟 With IAM:
    ✔️ Fine-grained access control
    ✔️ Least privilege principle
    ✔️ Secure multi-user AWS environment

🔄 IAM Core Components (MOST IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ IAM Users
Represents a human or application that needs AWS access.

🌟 Characteristics
➤ Has unique credentials
➤ Can log in via:
    ✔️ AWS Console
    ✔️ AWS CLI
    ✔️ SDK / API
➤ Credentials
    ✔️ Password (Console access)
    ✔️ Access Key + Secret Key (Programmatic access)
➤ Best Practices
    ❌ Never use root user
    ❌ Never hardcode access keys
    ✅ Enable MFA


2️⃣ IAM Groups
Collection of users with similar permissions.

❓ Why groups?
➤ Easier permission management
➤ Avoid assigning policies individually

✅ Example
➤ Developers group → EC2, S3 access
➤ Admins group → Full access
📌 Groups cannot contain groups


3️⃣ IAM Roles
Used to grant temporary permissions.

⚡ Key idea: Roles are assumed, not logged in.

➤ Used by
    ✔️ EC2
    ✔️ Lambda
    ✔️ ECS
    ✔️ Cross-account access

❓ Why roles instead of access keys?
    ✔️ Temporary credentials
    ✔️ Auto-rotation
    ✔️ More secure


✅ Common Scenario
➤ EC2 needs to access S3
➤ ✔ Attach IAM Role to EC2
➤ ❌ Don’t store access keys inside EC2


4️⃣ IAM Policies
Defines permissions in JSON format.

🔗 Types of Policies
    ✔️ AWS Managed Policies
    ✔️ Customer Managed Policies
    ✔️ Inline Policies

🔄 IAM Policy Structure (JSON)
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
🌟 Key Elements
➤ Effect → Allow / Deny
➤ Action → What can be done
➤ Resource → On which resource
➤ Condition → Optional constraints
📌 Explicit Deny always wins


🔄 Types of Access Control
1️⃣ Identity-Based Policies
➤ Attached to users, groups, roles
➤ Most common

2️⃣ Resource-Based Policies
Attached to resource itself
✅ Example:
    ✔️ S3 bucket policy
    ✔️ Lambda permission policy
📌 Resource-based policies allow cross-account access


🔄 IAM Authentication vs Authorization
| Concept        | Meaning         |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Authentication | Who you are     |
| Authorization  | What you can do |
➤ IAM handles both


🔄 Root User (High Risk Topic)
➤ Created when AWS account is created
➤ Has full unrestricted access

⚡ Root User Best Practices
➤ Enable MFA
➤ Never use for daily work
➤ Store credentials securely


🔄 IAM Security Best Practices 
➤ Principle of Least Privilege
➤ Use roles instead of access keys
➤ Enable MFA
➤ Rotate credentials
➤ Use IAM Access Analyzer
➤ Use AWS CloudTrail for auditing


🔄 IAM Global vs Regional
➤ IAM is GLOBAL
➤ Policies apply across all regions


🔄 Common Scenarios
Scenario 1️⃣
Lambda needs DynamoDB access
✔️ Assign IAM Role to Lambda

Scenario 2️⃣
One AWS account wants to access another account’s S3
✔️ Use IAM Role + Bucket Policy

Scenario 3️⃣
Give developer read-only EC2 access
✔️ Attach AWS managed policy: AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess


🔄 IAM vs Other Security Services
| Service         | Purpose                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| IAM             | Identity & access control |
| KMS             | Encryption                |
| Cognito         | App user authentication   |
| Secrets Manager | Secrets storage           |

🔄 How to Access the Application from Outside World?
1️⃣ Public IP / Elastic IP
➤ Assign public IP to EC2
➤ Or use Elastic IP (static)

2️⃣ Security Group Configuration
Allow inbound traffic:
    ✔️ HTTP → Port 80
    ✔️ HTTPS → Port 443
    ✔️ App port → 3000 / 8080
📌 Security Group acts as a firewall

3️⃣ URL Access
🔗 http://<public-ip>:<port>


🔄 Common Issues
⚡ App running but not accessible: Check Security Group inbound rules


🔄 How EC2 Is Exposed Publicly (Production Setup)
➤ Application Load Balancer
➤ Auto Scaling Group
➤ Multiple AZs


🔄 What Are AWS Regions?
A Region is a geographical area where AWS has data centers.
✅ Examples
    ✔️ us-east-1
    ✔️ ap-south-1 (Mumbai)


❓ Why regions exist
➤ Low latency
➤ Compliance
➤ Fault isolation


🔄 What Are Availability Zones (AZs)?
An Availability Zone is an isolated data center inside a region.

✅ Example
    ✔️ ap-south-1a
    ✔️ ap-south-1b
➤ Each region has multiple AZs
➤ AZs are physically separate
➤ Connected via high-speed network


🔄 Region vs Availability Zone
| Region           | Availability Zone        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Geographic area  | Data center              |
| Multiple AZs     | Inside one region        |
| Used for latency | Used for fault tolerance |


🔄 Why Multi-AZ is Important?
➤ High availability
➤ Fault tolerance
➤ Disaster recovery


##############################
🔷 Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
##############################
➤ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS where you launch and manage AWS resources.

➤ VPC is a private network in AWS that gives us full control over IP addressing, subnets, routing, and network security.


🔄 Why Do We Need VPC?
❗ Without VPC:
    ✔️ No network isolation
    ✔️ No control over IP ranges
    ✔️ No security boundaries

✅ With VPC:
    ✔️ Network isolation
    ✔️ Custom IP addressing
    ✔️ Controlled inbound/outbound traffic
    ✔️ Secure architecture
👉 We need VPC to design secure, isolated, and scalable cloud networks similar to on-premise data centers.


🔄 Core Components of VPC
1️⃣ CIDR Block
2️⃣ Subnets
3️⃣ Route Tables
4️⃣ Internet Gateway
5️⃣ NAT Gateway
6️⃣ Security Groups
7️⃣ Network ACLs


🔄 Concept of CIDR Block & Subnetting
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines the IP address range for the VPC.

✅ Example: 10.0.0.0/16
✔️ /16 → network bits
✔️ Total IPs = 65,536


🔄 Why CIDR is Important?
➤ Defines how many IPs are available
➤ Helps divide network into subnets
➤ Avoids IP conflicts


🔄 Subnetting Concept
Dividing a VPC CIDR into smaller IP ranges.

✅ Example:
✔️ VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
✔️ Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24
✔️ Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24
📌 Each subnet belongs to one AZ only


🔄 How VPC Components Interact
User → Internet → Internet Gateway → Route Table →
Public Subnet → EC2 Instance

🔗 For private access:
Private Subnet → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway


🔄 How to Create a VPC
Step-1️⃣: Create VPC
Step-2️⃣: Choose CIDR block
✅ Example: 10.0.0.0/16
📌 VPC is regional


🔄 How to Create Subnet (After VPC)
Steps:
1️⃣ Select VPC
2️⃣ Choose Availability Zone
3️⃣ Assign subnet CIDR
✅ Example:
Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24

📌 Subnet is AZ-specific


🔄 Public Subnet vs Private Subnet
🔁 Public Subnet
➤ Has route to Internet Gateway
➤ Used for:
    ✔️ EC2 (Web servers)
    ✔️ Load Balancer

🔁 Private Subnet
➤ No direct internet access
➤ Used for:
    ✔️ Databases
    ✔️ Backend services
⚡ A subnet becomes public or private based on route table configuration, not by name.


🔄 How to Create Internet Gateway (IGW)
(Used for internet access)
Steps:
1️⃣ Create Internet Gateway
2️⃣ Attach it to VPC
📌 One IGW per VPC


🔄 Route Table
➤ Controls where network traffic goes.
➤ Default Route Table
    ✔️ Allows internal VPC traffic


🔄 Public Route Table
➤ Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
➤ Associate with: Public Subnet

🔄 Private Route Table
➤ Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
➤ Associate with: Private Subnet


🔄 NAT Gateway (Private Subnet Internet Access)
➤ Allows outbound internet
➤ Blocks inbound internet
📌 Placed in public subnet


🔄 Security Components Interaction
1️⃣ Security Group
➤ Instance-level firewall
➤ Stateful
➤ Allow rules only

2️⃣ NACL
➤ Subnet-level firewall
➤ Stateless
➤ Allow & deny rules


🔄 VPC Setup Flow
➤ Create VPC (CIDR)
➤ Create Subnets (Public & Private)
➤ Create Internet Gateway
➤ Attach IGW to VPC
➤ Create Route Tables
➤ Add routes
➤ Associate route tables with subnets
➤ Launch EC2 in correct subnet
➤ Configure Security Groups

✅ Real-World Example:: Web Application Architecture
➤ Public Subnet → ALB, EC2
➤ Private Subnet → RDS
➤ NAT Gateway → Updates from private subnet


🔄 Common Traps
➤ Subnet ≠ AZ (Subnet belongs to AZ)
➤ Public subnet ≠ public IP
➤ IGW alone ≠ internet access
➤ Route table defines public/private
➤ NAT Gateway must be in public subnet
