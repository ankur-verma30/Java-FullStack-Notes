A network is simply a collection of devices (computers, mobiles, servers, routers) that communicate with each other.
To communicate, every device must have a unique identifier.
This identifier is called an IP Address.


🔷 IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network (Internet or private network).
It serves two main purposes:

1️⃣ Identification → Who the device is
2️⃣ Location addressing → Where the device is located in the network

Think of it like a home address used for delivering data packets instead of mail.

🔄 Why Do We Need an IP Address?
✔️ To uniquely identify each device on a network
✔️ To route data between devices
✔️ To ensure messages reach the correct destination
✔️ To differentiate between internal network devices and external devices
✔️ To enable communication between networks


🔄 Types of IP Addresses
🌟 Based on Version
1️⃣ IPv4
    ✔️ Oldest & most widely used
    ✔️ 32-bit address
    ✔️ Written as: A.B.C.D (4 octets)
        ✅ Example: 192.168.1.20
    ✔️ Total possible addresses:
        🔗 2³² = 4.29 billion
    ✔️ Problem → IP exhaustion (not enough addresses)

2️⃣ IPv6
    ➤ New version to fix IPv4 shortage
    ➤ 128-bit address
    ➤ Written in hexadecimal
        ✅ Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
    ➤ Total possible addresses:
        🔗 2¹²⁸ (almost infinite)
    ➤ Provides:
        ✔️ Better security (IPsec mandatory)
        ✔️ Auto-configuration
        ✔️ No NAT required

🌟 Types Based on Scope
1️⃣ Public IP
➤ Provided by ISP
➤ Can be accessed over the Internet
➤ Unique globally
✅ Example: IP of your WiFi router’s WAN interface

2️⃣ Private IP
➤ Used inside home/office LAN
➤ Not accessible from internet directly
➤ Range (IPv4):
    🔗 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
    🔗 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
    🔗 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
✅ Example: 192.168.1.10

🌟 Static vs Dynamic IP
1️⃣ Static IP
➤ Manually assigned
➤ Permanent
➤ Used for servers
✅ Example: Web server, database server

2️⃣ Dynamic IP
➤ Assigned automatically using DHCP Server
➤ Changes periodically
➤ Used for laptops, phones, home networks


🔄 Classful IPv4 Addressing
Used earlier for easy address allocation:
| Class | Range                       | Usage           |
| ----- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| A     | 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255   | Large networks  |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 | Medium networks |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 | Small networks  |
| D     | 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 | Multicasting    |
| E     | 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 | Research        |


🔄 IP Address Format
1️⃣ IPv4
➤ 32 bits → 4 octets (8 bits each)
✅ Example: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00010100 (binary)
= 192.168.1.20 (decimal)

2️⃣ IPv6
➤ 128 bits
➤ Divided into 8 blocks of 16 bits
➤ Hexadecimal

🔄 Subnet Mask & IP Address
➤ Subnet Mask helps to divide network into smaller networks.
➤ It determines:
    ✔️ Network portion of IP
    ✔️ Host portion of IP

✅ Example:
🔗 IP: 192.168.1.10
🔗 Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

🔗 Network part → 192.168.1
🔗 Host part → 10

🔄 NAT & IP Address
➤ Since IPv4 addresses are limited:
    ✔️ Private IPs are used inside LAN
    ✔️ Router converts private → public IP using NAT (Network Address Translation)
➤ This allows thousands of devices to share one public IP.

✅ 10. How IP Works (Simple Flow)
You send a request (e.g., google.com).
DNS converts domain → IP Address.
Router checks where to send the packet.
Packet travels through multiple routers.
Google’s server receives it using its IP.
Server responds back to your IP.


🔷 Subnet & Subnetting
A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a smaller part of a larger network, created by dividing an IP network into multiple logical segments.

In simple terms:
👉 A subnet is like dividing a big classroom into smaller groups so communication becomes easier and faster.

🧠 Why Do We Use Subnets?
➤ Reduce network congestion (less broadcast traffic)
➤ Improve security (separate departments: HR, Finance, Dev)
➤ Better IP address management
➤ Faster routing inside networks
➤ Avoid wastage of IP addresses

📌 How Subnet Actually Works
Every IP address has 2 parts:

🔗 Network Portion | Host Portion
Subnetting changes the boundary between network and host portions.

✅ Example:
🔗 IP: 192.168.1.10
🔗 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

👉 Here:
🔗 Network = 192.168.1
🔗 Host = .10

➤ If we subnet further using: 255.255.255.128
➤ This divides the network into 2 smaller subnets.

🔢 Subnet Mask
A subnet mask tells which part of the IP is network and which part is host.

✅ Example masks:
255.255.255.0 → /24
255.255.255.128 → /25
255.255.255.192 → /26

🔄 CIDR Notation
This is a short form of subnet mask:
/24, /25, /26

✅ Subnet Example 
Suppose you have 192.168.1.0/24
It means 256 IPs (0–255)

If you divide it into two subnets:
➤ Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/25 → 128 IPs
➤ Subnet 2: 192.168.1.128/25 → 128 IPs
👉 Now instead of one big network, you have two smaller logical networks.
