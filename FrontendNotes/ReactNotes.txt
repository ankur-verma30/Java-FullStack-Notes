===============================
🔷 What is React & Why React
🔄 React Definition
 React is a JavaScript librry for building user interfaces
➤ Focuses only on the View layer
➤ UI is built using components
➤ UI updates are declarative, not imperative


🔄 What React Is NOT
❌ Not a framework
❌ Not a full MVC solution
❌ Not responsible for routing, HTTP, or state persistence
❌ Not replacing JavaScript
✅ React does one thing extremely well → UI rendering.


🔄 Creation of React
Before React (Traditional UI Approach)
    ✔️ Direct DOM manipulation (jQuery, vanilla JS)
    ✔️ Manual UI updates
    ✔️ Tight coupling between state & UI
    ✔️ Hard to scale as UI grows

Problems:
    🚫 DOM updates are slow
    🚫 UI logic becomes complex & buggy
    🚫 No predictable rendering
    🚫 Code becomes unmaintainable in large apps


🔄 Facebook’s Problem (Real Origin)
1️⃣ News Feed UI had:
    ✔️ Frequent updates
    ✔️ Complex state
    ✔️ High interactivity
2️⃣ Manual DOM updates became unmanageable
➡️ React was created to solve UI complexity, not performance initially


🔄 Core Philosophy of React
1️⃣ Declarative UI
➤ You describe WHAT UI should look like
➤ React decides HOW to update it

UI = f(state)
👉 UI is a pure function of state


2️⃣ Component-Based Architecture
➤ UI is broken into independent reusable components
➤ Each component:
    ✔️ Has its own logic
    ✔️ Can manage its own state
    ✔️ Is reusable & testable


3️⃣ Unidirectional Data Flow
➤ Data flows top → down
➤ Parent controls child
➤ Predictable state changes


🔄 React Is Different
1️⃣ Virtual DOM
➤ React creates an in-memory representation of the DOM
➤ Changes are calculated first
➤ Only minimal real DOM updates are applied
👉 Real DOM is expensive, Virtual DOM is cheap


2️⃣ Efficient Reconciliation
➤ React compares previous & next Virtual DOM
➤ Finds minimal changes (diffing)
➤ Applies only necessary updates


3️⃣ Separation of Concerns
➤ Logic + UI live together (JSX)
➤ Opposite of traditional HTML/CSS/JS separation
➤ Improves maintainability at scale


🔄 React Instead of Vanilla JS
| Vanilla JS          | React                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Imperative          | Declarative           |
| Manual DOM updates  | Auto UI sync          |
| Hard to scale       | Scales well           |
| Spaghetti code risk | Structured components |
| State scattered     | Centralized state     |
Mental Model:
👉 Vanilla JS = Change this state
👉 React = Change the state


🔄 React Instead of jQuery
jQuery:
    ✔️ Direct DOM manipulation
    ✔️ No component model
    ✔️ No state abstraction

React:
    ✔️ Virtual DOM
    ✔️ Predictable state
    ✔️ Reusable components

➤ jQuery manipulates DOM
➤ React describes UI


🔄 Popularity of React
1️⃣ Technical Reasons
➤ Component reusability
➤ Performance via reconciliation
➤ Predictable rendering
➤ Strong ecosystem

2️⃣ Business Reasons
➤ Faster development
➤ Easier maintenance
➤ Large developer community
➤ Backed by Meta


🔄 React’s Role in Modern Apps
➤ Used for:
    ✔️ Dashboards
    ✔️ Admin panels
    ✔️ SaaS platforms
    ✔️ Large enterprise apps

➤ Not ideal for:
    ❌ Simple static websites
    ❌ Minimal UI logic apps


🔄 Common Misconceptions
❌ React is fast because Virtual DOM
✅ React is fast because of efficient diffing

❌ React replaces backend
✅ React is frontend only

❌ React automatically optimizes everything
✅ Bad code still causes bad performance


=======================================
🔷 SPA vs MPA (from React perspective)
=======================================
🔄 What is an Application (UI Perspective)
A web application = UI + Data + Navigation

❓ Key question: What happens when the user clicks a link or performs an action?
This answer defines SPA vs MPA.


🔄 Multi-Page Application (MPA)
➤ Every navigation loads a new HTML page from the server.
➤ Browser performs a full page reload.


🔄 How MPA Works
1️⃣ User clicks a link
2️⃣ Browser sends request to server
3️⃣ Server returns a new HTML document
4️⃣ Browser:
    ✔️ Destroys current DOM
    ✔️ Loads new DOM
    ✔️ Re-downloads assets (CSS, JS, images)
5️⃣ Page is re-rendered


🔄 Characteristics of MPA
➤ Multiple HTML files
➤ Server-driven rendering
➤ Each page is independent
➤ Navigation = network request

✅ Examples
    ✔️ Traditional websites
    ✔️ Old PHP/JSP/ASP apps
    ✔️ Server-side rendered pages without Hydration


🔄 Problems with MPA (Why React Exists)
1️⃣ Performance Issues
    🚫 Full page reloads
    🚫 UI Flicker
    🚫 Re-fetching assets
    🚫 Slower user experience

2️⃣ Developer Experience Issues
    🚫 Repeated layouts
    🚫 Hard to manage state across pages
    🚫 Complex navigation logic

3️⃣ State Problems
    🚫 State is lost on every navigation
    🚫 Hard to maintain:
        ✔️ Logged-in state
        ✔️ UI state
        ✔️ In-memory data


🔄 Single-Page Application (SPA)
➤ Application loads one HTML page once
➤ UI updates dynamically using JavaScript
➤ Navigation does NOT reload the page


🔄 How SPA Works
1️⃣ Browser loads index.html once
2️⃣ React JS bundle loads
3️⃣ React builds UI using JS
4️⃣ User clicks a link
5️⃣ React 
    ✔️ Change state
    ✔️ Updates components
    ✔️ Updates DOM
6️⃣ URL may change without page reload

Key Rule: Page never reloads ─────────▶ only components change


🔄 Why React is SPA-Oriented
React is designed for:
    ✔️ Long-living UI
    ✔️ Frequent state changes
    ✔️ Dynamic updates without reloads
    ✔️ Rich interactions


🔄 Difference between SPA and MPA
| Aspect            | MPA                 | SPA           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Page Load         | On every navigation | Once          |
| HTML              | Multiple            | Single        |
| Rendering         | Server-driven       | Client-driven |
| Navigation        | Full reload         | JS-based      |
| State Persistence | Lost                | Preserved     |
| UX                | Slower              | Faster        |
| React Fit         | ❌ Poor             | ✅ Perfect   |


🔄 Routing Difference
1️⃣ MPA Routing
➤ Handled by server such as /login, /home, /profile
➤ Each route = new HTML page

2️⃣ SPA Routing
➤ Handled by client (React Router)
➤ Each route = different component view
➤ URL changes without reload
➤ Browser History API is used to manage URLs without reloading the page.


🔄 State Management Implications
1️⃣ MPA State Management
➤ State stored in:
    ✔️ Server sessions
    ✔️ Cookies
    ✔️ DB
➤ UI state resets on reload

2️⃣ SPA State Management
➤ State stored in:
    ✔️ In-memory (React state)
    ✔️ Client storage (localStorage, IndexedDB)
    ✔️ Context API
    ✔️ Redux
➤ UI state persists across navigations


🔄 Performance Persistence
🔄 Initial Load
➤ MPA: ❌ Slower (big JS bundle)
➤ SPA: ✅ Faster

🔄 After Initial Load
➤ MPA: ❌ Slower (full reloads)
➤ SPA: ✅ Very fast


🔄 React Optimization Techniques
➤ Code Splitting
➤ Lazy Loading
➤ Memoization
➤ Caching

🔄 SEO Perspective
MPA:
    ✔️ SEO-friendly by default
    ✔️ HTML available immediately

SPA:
SEO issues historically
Needs:
    ✔️ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
    ✔️ Meta handling
    ✔️ Pre-rendering
That is why Next.js is popular for React SEO needs.


When React SPA is a Bad Choice
❌ Simple static sites
❌ Content-heavy blogs
❌ Simple landing pages
❌ Apps needing full SEO (without SSR)


🔄 When to Choose SPA with React
✅ Admin Dashboards
✅ SaaS products
✅ Social media apps
✅ E-commerce apps


===============================
🔷 React Architecture Overview
===============================
🔄 What “React Architecture” Means
From React POV, architecture answers:
➤ How React thinks
➤ How React builds UI
➤ How React updates UI
➤ How React manages changes over time
👉 React architecture is about rendering, reconciliation, and committing UI updates efficiently.


🔄 High-Level React Architecture
React internally works in three major layers:

State / Props Change
        ↓
Render Phase (Virtual DOM)
        ↓
Reconciliation (Diffing)
        ↓
Commit Phase (Real DOM Update)


🔄 Core Building Blocks of React
1️⃣ React Elements
➤ Smallest unit in React
➤ Plain JavaScript objects
➤ Describe what the UI should look like
{
  type: 'div',
  props: { children: 'Hello' }
}
👉 React elements are NOT DOM nodes


2️⃣ Components
➤ Functions (or classes) that return React elements
➤ Encapsulate UI + logic
➤ Reusable and composable


3️⃣ Virtual DOM (Fiber Tree)
➤ In-memory representation of UI
➤ Stored as a Fiber Tree
➤ Used to calculate changes before touching real DOM


4️⃣ Reconciler
➤ Compares old Fiber Tree with new one
➤ Finds minimal set of changes
➤ Decides what must be updated

5️⃣ Renderer
➤ Applies changes to target platform
✅ Examples:
    ✔️ ReactDOM → Browser
    ✔️ React Native → Mobile
    ✔️ React Three Fiber → WebGL


🔄 React Rendering Pipeline
1️⃣ State / props change
2️⃣ React calls component functions
3️⃣ New React elements are created
4️⃣ New Fiber Tree is built
5️⃣ Reconciliation happens
6️⃣ DOM updates are prepared
7️⃣ Changes committed to real DOM


🔄 Render Phase vs Commit Phase (Very Important)
1️⃣ Render Phase
➤ Pure calculation
➤ No DOM updates
➤ Can be paused, restarted, or discarded
➤ Runs component functions

2️⃣ Commit Phase
➤ Actual DOM updates
➤ Cannot be interrupted
➤ Effects (useEffect) are scheduled
👉 React may render multiple times before committing once


🔄 React Fiber Architecture (Why React Is Powerful)
1️⃣ Why Fiber Was Introduced
➤ Old Stack reconciler was synchronous
➤ Large UI updates blocked main thread


2️⃣ Fiber Enables
➤ Interruptible rendering
➤ Priority-based updates
➤ Concurrent rendering
➤ Better UX


3️⃣ Fiber Node Represents
➤ A component
➤ A DOM element
➤ A fragment
➤ A provider


🔄 React’s Internal Trees
React maintains multiple trees:
    ✔️ Current Tree → what user sees
    ✔️ Work-In-Progress Tree → new changes
    ✔️ Alternate Tree → for diffing


🔄 Scheduling & Priority
React assigns priorities:
    ✔️ User interactions → high priority
    ✔️ Data fetching → low priority
    ✔️ Background updates → deferred
👉 Enables smooth UI under heavy load


🔄 Hooks & Architecture
Hooks integrate deeply:
➤ Hooks run during render phase
➤ Order of hooks is critical
➤ Hook state stored in Fiber nodes
➤ Same hook order = correct mapping


🔄 Event System Architecture
➤ React uses Synthetic Events
➤ Single event listener per event type
➤ Event delegation at root
➤ Normalized behavior across browsers


🔄 Data Flow Architecture
➤ Unidirectional
➤ Parent → Child
➤ State changes flow downward
➤ UI updates flow upward via callbacks


🔄 Separation of Responsibilities
| Layer      | Responsibility  |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| React Core | Component logic |
| Reconciler | Diffing         |
| Renderer   | DOM updates     |
| Scheduler  | Priority        |
| Hooks      | State & effects |


🔄 What Triggers Re-Render (Architecture POV)
➤ State update
➤ Props change
➤ Context value change
➤ Parent re-render
👉 React does NOT re-render because DOM changed


🔄 Common Architectural Misconceptions
❌ React updates DOM directly
✅ React updates Virtual DOM first

❌ Re-render = DOM update
✅ Re-render = recalculation

❌ Hooks store state globally
✅ State is stored per Fiber 


======================
🔷 React Virtual DOM
======================
🔄 Real DOM (Browser DOM)
➤ Tree representation of HTML
➤ Each node = actual browser object
➤ Direct manipulation triggers:
    ✔️ Layout
    ✔️ Paint
    ✔️ Reflow
➤ Expensive operations


🔄 Problem with Real DOM
➤ Updating DOM frequently = slow
➤ Manual DOM manipulation = complex
➤ Hard to track UI changes


🔄 What is Virtual DOM
➤ Virtual DOM is an in-memory JavaScript representation of the real DOM
➤ Lightweight & fast
➤ Exists only inside React


🔄 What Virtual DOM is NOT
❌ Not a browser feature
❌ Not faster than real DOM by itself
❌ Not a magic performance booster
❌ Not React Fiber itself
👉 Virtual DOM is a strategy, not a performance hack


🔄 Why Virtual DOM Was Needed
Core Problem
➤ UI changes frequently
➤ DOM operations are expensive
➤ React needed a way to:
    ✔️ Batch updates
    ✔️ Minimize DOM writes
    ✔️ Make rendering predictable


🔄 How Virtual DOM Works
1️⃣ Initial Render
➤ JSX → React.createElement
➤ React creates Virtual DOM tree
➤ React creates Real DOM
➤ DOM is mounted


2️⃣ Update Cycle
➤ State changes
➤ Component re-executes
➤ New Virtual DOM tree created
➤ Old vs New Virtual DOM compared
➤ Differences calculated
➤ Minimal real DOM updates applied


🔄 Virtual DOM Internals
Virtual DOM nodes are plain JS objects
✅ Example:

{
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    className: 'box',
    children: 'Hello'
  }
}
➤ No layout
➤ No painting
➤ No browser interaction


🔄 Virtual DOM vs Real DOM
| Aspect       | Virtual DOM | Real DOM      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| Location     | Memory      | Browser       |
| Speed        | Fast        | Slow          |
| Updates      | Cheap       | Expensive     |
| Structure    | JS Objects  | DOM Nodes     |
| Side Effects | None        | Layout/Reflow |


🔄 Why Virtual DOM Improves Performance
❌ Wrong Belief
Virtual DOM is faster than real DOM


✅ Correct Truth
Virtual DOM allows React to:
    ✔️ Batch updates
    ✔️ Calculate minimal DOM operations
    ✔️ Avoid unnecessary changes
👉 Performance comes from diffing + batching, not from Virtual DOM itself


🔄 Virtual DOM & Re-rendering
➤ State change → re-render
➤ Re-render = new Virtual DOM
➤ React does NOT update DOM immediately
➤ DOM update happens after diffing


🔄 Virtual DOM & Reconciliation
➤ Reconciliation = process of comparing:
    ✔️ Previous Virtual DOM
    ✔️ New Virtual DOM

➤ Determines:
    ✔️ What changed
    ✔️ What stayed same
    ✔️ What needs DOM updates
👉 Virtual DOM is the input to reconciliation


🔄 Fiber & Virtual DOM Relationship
➤ Fiber is the data structure
➤ Virtual DOM is the concept
➤ Fiber nodes represent:
    ✔️ Components
    ✔️ DOM elements
    ✔️ Hooks state


🔄 Common Virtual DOM Misconceptions
❌ Virtual DOM avoids DOM completely
✅ DOM is still updated

❌ Virtual DOM updates only changed components
✅ Whole subtree is recalculated, DOM update is selective

❌ Virtual DOM eliminates re-render cost
✅ Re-render still costs CPU


🔄 Performance Pitfalls Related to Virtual DOM
➤ Unnecessary re-renders
➤ Large component trees
➤ Missing keys in lists
➤ Inline object/array creation
➤ Expensive render logic


🔄 When Virtual DOM Doesn’t Help
➤ Heavy computations in render
➤ Frequent state updates
➤ Large unoptimized lists
➤ Poor component structure


=============================
🔷 Reconciliation Algorithm
=============================
Reconciliation is the process of comparing the previous UI tree with the new UI tree and deciding what needs to change in the real DOM.


🔄 Why Reconciliation Exists
🌟 Core Problem
➤ On every state/props change:
    ✔️ React re-executes components
    ✔️ A new Virtual DOM tree is produced
➤ Comparing two arbitrary trees is O(n³) (too slow)
➡️ React uses heuristics to make this O(n).


🔄 Reconciliation in React’s Architecture
State / Props Change
        ↓
Re-render Components
        ↓
New Virtual DOM Tree
        ↓
Reconciliation (Diffing)
        ↓
Minimal DOM Mutations
👉 Reconciliation runs before the commit phase.


🔄 Core Assumptions (Heuristics) React Uses
React’s reconciliation algorithm is based on two critical assumptions:
1️⃣ Different Element Types = Different Trees
<div />
<span />

➤ React assumes they are completely different
➤ Old subtree is destroyed
➤ New subtree is created
👉 No deep comparison across different types


2️⃣ Stable Keys Preserve Identity
{items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} />)}

➤ Keys help React match:
    ✔️ Old nodes
    ✔️ New nodes
➤ Without keys → React falls back to index-based matching


🔄 Reconciliation Rules
Case 1️⃣: Same Type, Same Key
➤ Reuse existing DOM node
➤ Update only changed props
➤ Reconcile children recursively

Case 2️⃣: Same Type, Different Props
➤ DOM node reused
➤ Only prop differences applied

Case 3️⃣: Different Type
➤ Old node unmounted
➤ New node mounted
➤ State is lost

Case 4️⃣: Lists with Keys
➤ Keys define identity
➤ React:
    ✔️ Moves nodes
    ✔️ Inserts new ones
    ✔️ Removes deleted ones


🔄 Reconciliation of Lists
1️⃣ Without Keys
{items.map(item => <Item />)}

➤ React uses index
➤ Causes:
    ✔️ Wrong DOM reuse
    ✔️ State bugs
    ✔️ Performance issues

2️⃣ With Keys
{items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} />)}

➤ Stable identity
➤ Correct matching
➤ Minimal DOM updates


🔄 Why Keys Matter
➤ Keys tell React: “This element corresponds to the same entity across renders”
➤ React builds a map of keys → fibers
➤ Efficient lookup instead of sequential matching


🔄 Reconciliation & Component State
➤ If component is reused: State is preserved
➤ If component is destroyed: State is reset
➤ Reconciliation decides state preservation


🔄 Fiber’s Role in Reconciliation
➤ Fiber represents a unit of work
➤ Reconciliation:
    ✔️ Creates work-in-progress Fiber tree
    ✔️ Compares with current Fiber tree
➤ Fiber enables:
    ✔️ Pausing
    ✔️ Resuming
    ✔️ Aborting reconciliation


🔄 Render Phase vs Commit Phase
Reconciliation happens in:
    ✔️ Render phase
    ✔️ Pure computation
    ✔️ No DOM mutation

DOM updates happen in:
    ✔️ Commit phase
    ✔️ Side effects applied


🔄 Performance Characteristics
1️⃣ Complexity
➤ O(n) due to heuristics
➤ Fast enough for large trees

2️⃣ Performance Bottlenecks
➤ Large component trees
➤ Frequent re-renders
➤ Poor key choices
➤ Inline object/array props


🔄 Common Reconciliation Anti-Patterns
➤ Using array index as key
➤ Changing keys on every render
➤ Conditional component types
➤ Deep component nesting


🔄 Traps
❌ “React compares entire DOM trees deeply”
✅ React uses heuristics, not deep diff

❌ “Keys improve rendering speed automatically”
✅ Keys improve correctness & identity matching

❌ “Reconciliation updates DOM”
✅ Reconciliation calculates, commit mutates


=============================
🔷 React Fiber Architecture
=============================
🔄 React Fiber
➤ Fiber is React’s new internal reconciliation engine
➤ Introduced in React 16
➤ Replaced the old Stack Reconciler
👉 Fiber is not a feature — it’s an internal architecture change.


🔄 Why Fiber Was Introduced
🚫 Problem with Old Stack Reconciler
➤ Rendering was synchronous
➤ Large updates:
    ✔️ Blocked the main thread
    ✔️ Caused jank & freezes
➤ No way to pause or prioritize work


🔄 Real-World Issue
➤ User scrolls
➤ Large component tree update happens
➤ UI freezes ❌
➡️ Fiber solved this.


🔄 Core Goal of Fiber
React Fiber enables:
🟢 Interruptible rendering
🟢 Prioritized updates
🟢 Better user experience
🟢 Concurrent features
👉 Fiber’s goal is responsiveness, not raw speed.


🔄 Conceptual Understanding of Fiber
1️⃣ Fiber (High-Level)
➤ A unit of work
➤ A node in React’s internal tree
➤ Each component = one Fiber node

2️⃣ Fiber Stores
➤ Component type
➤ Props
➤ State
➤ Hooks state
➤ Effect info
➤ Child / sibling / parent links


🔄 Fiber Tree vs Virtual DOM
| Concept     | Purpose                |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Virtual DOM | UI description         |
| Fiber Tree  | Execution & scheduling |
👉 Fiber is the data structure that powers reconciliation.


🔄 How Fiber Changes Rendering
Old Model (Stack Reconciler)
Render everything → Block UI → Commit


🔄 Fiber Model
Break work into units
↓
Pause if needed
↓
Resume later
↓
Commit when ready


🔄 Render Phase in Fiber
Fiber breaks rendering into:
    ✔️ Small units of work

React can:
    ✔️ Pause rendering
    ✔️ Abort rendering
    ✔️ Restart rendering
👉 Render phase is interruptible


🔄 Commit Phase
➤ Commit phase:
    ✔️ Applies DOM updates
    ✔️ Runs effects
➤ Not interruptible


🔄 Priority-Based Scheduling
Fiber assigns priorities:
➤ User input → High
➤ Animations → Medium
➤ Data fetch → Low
👉 React schedules work accordingly to keep UI responsive.


🔄 Concurrency
Fiber enables:
➤ Concurrent rendering
➤ Time slicing
➤ Background updates
👉 React can prepare UI without blocking user interaction.


🔄 Hooks & Fiber (Why Rules Exist)
➤ Hooks state is stored on Fiber nodes
➤ Hook order matters
➤ Same call order → same Fiber mapping
➡️ This is why Rules of Hooks exist


🔄 Fiber Enables Modern React Features
Fiber is the foundation for:
➤ Concurrent rendering
➤ Transitions
➤ Suspense
➤ Deferred updates
➤ Automatic batching


🔄 What Fiber Does NOT Do
❌ Fiber does NOT make React automatically faster
❌ Fiber does NOT remove re-renders
❌ Fiber does NOT change public API


🔄 Traps
❌ “Fiber is Virtual DOM”
✅ Fiber implements Virtual DOM

❌ “Fiber is async rendering”
✅ Fiber enables interruptible rendering

❌ “Fiber is only for performance”
✅ Fiber is for responsiveness


=======================
🔷 JSX Syntax & Rules
=======================
🔄 JSX
➤ JSX = JavaScript XML
➤ Syntax extension for JavaScript
➤ Used to describe UI structure
const element = <h1>Hello</h1>;

👉 JSX is a syntax sugar that allows writing UI code declaratively, which is later transformed into React.createElement calls.


🔄 JSX is NOT HTML
➤ JSX looks like HTML
➤ JSX is JavaScript
➤ Parsed by Babel, not browser
➤ Follows JS rules, not HTML rules


🔄 Why JSX Exists
Problem Without JSX
React.createElement(
  'div',
  null,
  React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello')
);

➤ Hard to read
➤ Hard to maintain
➤ Poor developer experience

JSX Solves:
➤ Readability
➤ Declarative UI
➤ Component composability


🔄 JSX Compilation
JSX Code
<h1 className="title">Hello</h1>

Compiles To
React.createElement(
  'h1',
  { className: 'title' },
  'Hello'
);
👉 JSX never runs in browser directly.


🔄 JSX Syntax Rules
1️⃣ Single Parent Rule
return (
  <div>
    <h1 />
    <p />
  </div>
);

❌ Invalid:
<h1 />
<p />


2️⃣ Use className (Not class)
<div className="box" />
Reason: class is a reserved JS keyword


3️⃣ Self-Closing Tags
<img />
<input />


4️⃣ CamelCase Attributes
onClick
tabIndex
htmlFor


5️⃣ JavaScript Expressions in {}
<h1>{user.name}</h1>
➤ Allowed:
    ✔️ Variables
    ✔️ Function calls
    ✔️ Ternary expressions

➤ Not allowed:
    ✔️ if
    ✔️ for
    ✔️ while


🔄 Conditional Rendering in JSX
➤ Using Ternary: {isLoggedIn ? <Home /> : <Login />}
➤ Using Logical AND: {isAdmin && <AdminPanel />}

👉 Common Trap: {count && <p>{count}</p>}
0 is falsy → nothing renders


🔄 JSX Children Rules
<Component>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
</Component>

➤ Children passed as props.children
➤ Can be:
    ✔️ Element
    ✔️ String
    ✔️ Array
    ✔️ Function


🔄 JSX & Expressions vs Statements (Important)
| Allowed             | Not Allowed |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| `user.name`         | `if`        |
| `a + b`             | `for`       |
| `condition ? x : y` | `switch`    |
👉 JSX allows expressions only


🔄 JSX & Lists
{items.map(item => (
  <Item key={item.id} />
))}

Rules:
➤ Always use key
➤ Keys must be stable
➤ Avoid index as key


🔄 JSX Fragments
1️⃣ Long Syntax
<React.Fragment>
  <h1 />
  <p />
</React.Fragment>

2️⃣ Short Syntax
<>
  <h1 />
  <p />
</>


🔄 JSX & Boolean / Null Rendering
| Value       | Rendered?  |
| ----------- | ---------  |
| `null`      | ❌         |
| `undefined` | ❌         |
| `false`     | ❌         |
| `true`      | ❌         |
| `0`         | ✅         |


🔄 JSX & Inline Styles
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }} />

Rules:
➤ Style is an object
➤ CamelCase keys
➤ Values are strings or numbers


🔄 JSX & Security (XSS)
➤ JSX escapes values by default
➤ Prevents XSS attacks
<p>{userInput}</p> // safe

Dangerous API: dangerouslySetInnerHTML


🔄 Common JSX Anti-Patterns
➤ Inline object creation
➤ Complex logic inside JSX
➤ Using index as key
➤ Heavy computations in JSX


🔄 JSX Performance Considerations
➤ JSX creates new objects on every render
➤ Expensive expressions cause re-render cost
➤ Extract logic outside JSX


🔄 JSX Traps
❌ JSX is HTML
✅ JSX is JavaScript

❌ JSX is required for React
✅ React works without JSX

❌ JSX improves performance
✅ JSX improves readability
