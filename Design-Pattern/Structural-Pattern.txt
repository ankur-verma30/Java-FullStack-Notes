🔷 Decorator Pattern
The Decorator pattern allows you to dynamically add new behavior or responsibilities to an object without modifying its existing code.

👉 Purpose:
To extend the functionality of objects at runtime, not at compile time — unlike inheritance. 

🔄 Real-World Analogy

Think of a coffee shop ☕:
➤ You start with a plain coffee.
➤ Then you can add milk, sugar, or cream — each decorator adds extra behavior (cost + description).

You didn’t modify the base coffee class — you just wrapped it!


🔄 Structure
➤ Component (Interface): Defines the base behavior.
➤ Concrete Component: The original object that we decorate.
➤ Decorator (Abstract Class): Holds a reference to the component and delegates operations to it.
➤ Concrete Decorators: Add new behavior around the base component.

✅ Example:
Coffee Order System
1️⃣ Component
interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}

2️⃣ Concrete Component
class BasicCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Basic Coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return 50;
    }
}

3️⃣ Abstract Decorator
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee decoratedCoffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = decoratedCoffee;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription();
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost();
    }
}

4️⃣ Concrete Decorators
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 10;
    }
}

class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 5;
    }
}

class CreamDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public CreamDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Cream";
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 15;
    }
}

5️⃣ Client
public class DecoratorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new BasicCoffee();                     // Base
        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);                    // Add milk
        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);                   // Add sugar
        coffee = new CreamDecorator(coffee);                   // Add cream

        System.out.println("Order: " + coffee.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Total Cost: ₹" + coffee.getCost());
    }
}
✅ Output
Order: Basic Coffee, Milk, Sugar, Cream
Total Cost: ₹80.0

🔄 Where Used in Java
| Class                                          | Decorator Role                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `java.io.BufferedReader`                       | Decorates `Reader`                    |
| `java.io.DataInputStream`                      | Decorates `InputStream`               |
| `java.util.Collections.synchronizedList()`     | Returns a decorated version of a List |
| `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper` | Decorates a servlet request           |

🔄 Spring Boot 
In Spring Boot, Decorator pattern is commonly seen when adding behavior to Beans or Services dynamically.


✅ Example: Logging Decorator for a Payment Service
1️⃣ Component
public interface PaymentService {
    void pay(double amount);
}

2️⃣ Concrete Component
@Service
class BasicPaymentService implements PaymentService {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment of ₹" + amount);
    }
}

3️⃣ Decorator
@Service
@Primary  // ensures this bean is used when autowired
class LoggingPaymentDecorator implements PaymentService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public LoggingPaymentDecorator(BasicPaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Logging: Payment started...");
        paymentService.pay(amount);
        System.out.println("Logging: Payment completed successfully.");
    }
}


👉 Usage in Controller:
@RestController
public class PaymentController {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public PaymentController(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/pay")
    public String pay(@RequestParam double amount) {
        paymentService.pay(amount);
        return "Payment Successful";
    }
}
👉 This dynamically adds logging behavior without changing the original BasicPaymentService.


Decorator 🆚 Inheritance
| Aspect                | Decorator           | Inheritance              |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Flexibility           | ✅ Runtime extension | ❌ Compile-time extension |
| Class explosion       | ❌ Reduced           | ✅ Increases              |
| Open/Closed Principle | ✅ Respected         | ❌ Often violated         |
| Multiple Behaviors    | ✅ Easy to combine   | ❌ Harder to combine      |


🔄 Where to Use in Projects
➤ Add logging, caching, security, validation, metrics to services dynamically.
➤ Add response formatting or data enrichment in REST APIs.
➤ Wrap repository/service beans for AOP-like behavior without using aspects.
➤ Wrap HttpServletRequest or HttpResponse objects.

🔄 Advantages
Adds new behavior without modifying existing code (Open/Closed Principle).
Can combine multiple decorators flexibly.
Promotes composition over inheritance.

🔄 Disadvantages
Increases number of small objects.
Can become hard to debug if too many decorators wrap each other.
Order of decorators matters.

 
🔷 Adapter Design Pattern
➤ The Adapter pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
➤ It acts as a bridge between a client expecting one type of interface and a class having a different interface.

👉 Purpose:
To make incompatible classes compatible without changing their source code.

🔄 Real-world Analogy
➤ Think of a mobile charger adapter 🔌:
➤ Your phone expects a Type-C port.
➤ But the wall socket is AC power.
➤ The charger adapter converts AC → DC (interface translation).

Similarly, the Adapter pattern converts one interface into another expected by the client.

⚙️ Structure
Target Interface: The interface the client expects to use.
Adaptee: The existing class with an incompatible interface.
Adapter: A class that bridges the gap by implementing the Target and internally using the Adaptee.
Client: Uses the Target interface to interact with the Adaptee indirectly.

✅ Java Example: Media Player
1️⃣ Target Interface
interface MediaPlayer {
    void play(String audioType, String fileName);
}

2️⃣ Adaptee
class AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public void playVlc(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing vlc file: " + fileName);
    }
    public void playMp4(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing mp4 file: " + fileName);
    }
}

3️⃣ Adapter
class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    private AdvancedMediaPlayer advancedMediaPlayer = new AdvancedMediaPlayer();

    @Override
    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc")) {
            advancedMediaPlayer.playVlc(fileName);
        } else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            advancedMediaPlayer.playMp4(fileName);
        }
    }
}

4️⃣ Concrete Target Implementation (using Adapter)
class AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
    private MediaAdapter mediaAdapter;

    @Override
    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp3")) {
            System.out.println("Playing mp3 file: " + fileName);
        } else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc") || audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter();
            mediaAdapter.play(audioType, fileName);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid media type: " + audioType);
        }
    }
}

5️⃣ Client
public class AdapterPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AudioPlayer player = new AudioPlayer();
        player.play("mp3", "song1.mp3");
        player.play("mp4", "movie.mp4");
        player.play("vlc", "video.vlc");
        player.play("avi", "old.avi");
    }
}

✅ Output
Playing mp3 file: song1.mp3
Playing mp4 file: movie.mp4
Playing vlc file: video.vlc
Invalid media type: avi


🔄 Where Used in Java
| Java API                                                            | Role                                  |

| `java.io.InputStreamReader`                                         | Adapts `InputStream` → `Reader`       |
| `java.io.OutputStreamWriter`                                        | Adapts `OutputStream` → `Writer`      |
| `java.util.Enumeration` → `Iterator` adapter (`Collections.list()`) |                                       |
| `javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter`                     | Converts between XML and Java objects |


✅ Example:
Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("file.txt"));
👉 InputStreamReader acts as an Adapter between byte streams and character streams.

🔄 Spring Boot 
In Spring, adapters are used extensively for integration between different interfaces.

✅ Example 1: HandlerAdapter in Spring MVC
Spring MVC uses the Adapter pattern internally to allow different types of controllers to be processed uniformly.

➤ DispatcherServlet doesn’t know about specific controller types.
➤ It uses a HandlerAdapter to adapt each controller type into a standard format.

public interface HandlerAdapter {
    boolean supports(Object handler);
    ModelAndView handle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler);
}
✅ Example:
➤ SimpleControllerHandlerAdapter adapts Controller interface-based controllers.
➤ RequestMappingHandlerAdapter adapts @RequestMapping annotated controllers.
So Spring Boot internally uses the Adapter pattern to make DispatcherServlet independent of controller types.


✅ Example 2: Custom Adapter in a Project
Suppose your app needs to integrate with two payment APIs (different formats).
You can use the Adapter pattern to unify them.

1️⃣ Target
public interface PaymentGateway {
    void pay(double amount);
}

2️⃣ Adaptee 1 - Razorpay API
class RazorpayAPI {
    public void makePayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Payment of ₹" + amount + " done via Razorpay.");
    }
}

3️⃣ Adapter
@Component
class RazorpayAdapter implements PaymentGateway {
    private final RazorpayAPI razorpayAPI = new RazorpayAPI();

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        razorpayAPI.makePayment(amount);
    }
}

4️⃣ Service using Target interface
@Service
public class PaymentService {
    private final PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    @Autowired
    public PaymentService(PaymentGateway paymentGateway) {
        this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        paymentGateway.pay(amount);
    }
}
✅ This approach lets you easily switch adapters (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) without changing service logic.


🔄 Adapter 🆚 Decorator vs Bridge
| Pattern       | Purpose                                  | Example             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Convert one interface to another         | `InputStreamReader` |
| **Decorator** | Add new behavior dynamically             | `BufferedReader`    |
| **Bridge**    | Separate abstraction from implementation | JDBC Drivers        |


🔄 Where to Use in Projects
✔️ When integrating legacy systems with new APIs
✔️ When using third-party libraries that don’t match your app interface
✔️ When you want to reuse existing classes without modifying them
✔️ When standardizing APIs (e.g., multiple payment or messaging gateways)


🔄 Advantages
➤ Promotes code reusability (no need to rewrite incompatible classes).
➤ Enables integration between legacy and new systems.
➤ Follows Open/Closed Principle — no modification to existing classes.

🔄 Disadvantages
➤ Adds extra layers (slight performance overhead).
➤ Can become complex if overused.
➤ Adapter logic might hide real implementation details.


🔄 Adapter = Backward Compatibility Layer
👉 Purpose Recap:
The Adapter Pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces —
it lets old code work with new code (or vice versa) without modifying existing logic.


🔄 How It Enables Backward Compatibility
Imagine a scenario:

➤ You have old client code using interface OldPaymentGateway.
➤ A new system introduces NewPaymentGateway, which works differently.
➤ You can’t change all existing client code — it’s already in production.

✅ Solution:
You create an Adapter that implements the OldPaymentGateway interface but internally calls the NewPaymentGateway.

So —
The adapter acts as a translator between old and new interfaces, ensuring that older clients can continue working even after system upgrades.


✅ Example (Backward Compatibility in Java)
// Old Interface (used by existing code)
interface OldPaymentGateway {
    void makePayment(int amount);
}

// New class (new API or upgraded service)
class NewPaymentGateway {
    public void processPayment(double amountInRupees) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment of ₹" + amountInRupees + " via New Gateway");
    }
}

// Adapter to connect old system to new one
class PaymentAdapter implements OldPaymentGateway {
    private final NewPaymentGateway newGateway;

    public PaymentAdapter(NewPaymentGateway newGateway) {
        this.newGateway = newGateway;
    }

    @Override
    public void makePayment(int amount) {
        newGateway.processPayment(amount); // adapts call
    }
}

// Client (old code)
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OldPaymentGateway gateway = new PaymentAdapter(new NewPaymentGateway());
        gateway.makePayment(500);  // Old method call, new system works!
    }
}
✅ Output:
Processing payment of ₹500.0 via New Gateway

🧩 In Frameworks (like Spring / Java APIs)
Yes — many frameworks use adapters for compatibility and extension without breaking old code:

✅Examples:
1️⃣ Spring MVC Adapters —
➤ HandlerAdapter adapts different controller types (e.g., @Controller, @RestController, or legacy ones).
➤ Allows Spring to evolve without breaking existing controllers.

2️⃣ Java JDBC Drivers —
➤ Adapters let newer JDBC versions work with older driver implementations.

3️⃣ Java I/O Streams —
➤ InputStreamReader acts as an adapter between byte streams and character streams.

🔄  Why It’s Important in Technology Evolution
➤ Technologies evolve (e.g., Java 8 → 17, Spring 4 → 6).
➤ But millions of projects still depend on older APIs.
➤ Rather than forcing developers to rewrite everything, frameworks introduce adapters or wrappers —
so new internal implementations can still support legacy interfaces.
👉 Adapters = Smooth upgrade path without breaking old functionality



🔷 Facade Design Pattern
The Facade Pattern provides a unified and simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, libraries, or APIs.

Think of it as a “front desk” of a hotel — you don’t deal with room service, billing, and cleaning directly — the reception desk (facade) handles everything for you.


🔄 Intent
➤ To hide system complexity
➤ To decouple client code from subsystems
➤ To make the API cleaner and easier to use


🔄 Structure
1️⃣ Facade Class
    ✔️ Provides high-level, easy-to-use methods.
    ✔️ Internally delegates calls to multiple complex subsystem classes.
2️⃣ Subsystem Classes
    ✔️ Implement actual logic and complex workflows.
3️⃣ Client
    ✔️ Uses the Facade interface instead of interacting with all subsystems directly.

✅ Example — Banking System
Imagine a banking application where multiple operations are needed to open an account (e.g., KYC verification, document checking, account creation, notification).

Instead of letting the user call each of them, we’ll create a BankService Facade that simplifies it.

1️⃣ Subsystem Classes
class KYCService {
    public void verifyDocuments(String name) {
        System.out.println("Verifying KYC documents for: " + name);
    }
}

class AccountService {
    public void createAccount(String name) {
        System.out.println("Creating account for: " + name);
    }
}

class NotificationService {
    public void sendWelcomeMessage(String name) {
        System.out.println("Sending welcome message to: " + name);
    }
}

2️⃣ Facade Class
class BankServiceFacade {
    private final KYCService kycService;
    private final AccountService accountService;
    private final NotificationService notificationService;

    public BankServiceFacade() {
        this.kycService = new KYCService();
        this.accountService = new AccountService();
        this.notificationService = new NotificationService();
    }

    public void openAccount(String name) {
        kycService.verifyDocuments(name);
        accountService.createAccount(name);
        notificationService.sendWelcomeMessage(name);
        System.out.println("Account successfully opened for " + name + "\n");
    }
}

3️⃣ Client Code
public class FacadePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankServiceFacade bankService = new BankServiceFacade();
        bankService.openAccount("Ankur Verma");
    }
}
✅ Output
Verifying KYC documents for: Ankur Verma
Creating account for: Ankur Verma
Sending welcome message to: Ankur Verma
Account successfully opened for Ankur Verma


🔄 Real-Life Example in Java
1️⃣ JDBC API
👉 When we use JDBC:

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

➤ DriverManager acts as a Facade.
➤ Internally, it talks to different JDBC drivers, connection pools, etc.

2️⃣ Spring Framework
In Spring Boot, the Facade Pattern is used heavily:

➤ Spring’s JdbcTemplate, RestTemplate, KafkaTemplate, JmsTemplate are all facades.
➤ They simplify complex subsystems (like handling connections, exceptions, serialization).

restTemplate.getForObject("https://api.github.com/users/ankur-verma30", String.class);

👉 Internally, it handles:
✔️ HTTP connection creation
✔️ Request/response mapping
✔️ Error handling
✔️ Deserialization
➤ All hidden behind one simple method — classic Facade.

3️⃣ Spring Security
SecurityContextHolder acts as a Facade to simplify authentication and authorization details.

4️⃣ Hibernate
SessionFactory and EntityManager act as Facades to hide complex ORM logic and SQL execution.


🔄 Where to Use
➤ When you have a large system with multiple subsystems.+
➤ When you want to simplify API usage for higher layers (like Controllers or Services).+
➤ When you want to reduce coupling between client and system components.

⚖️ Advantages
➤ Simplifies usage of complex systems.
➤ Improves code readability and maintainability.
➤ Reduces coupling between client and subsystems.
➤ Makes system easier to test and mock.

🚫 Disadvantages
❌ Can become a “god class” if overloaded with too many responsibilities.
❌ Hiding details may reduce flexibility for advanced users.


🔷 Proxy Design Pattern
➤ The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate (substitute) or placeholder object that controls access to another object — known as the real subject.
➤ Instead of calling the real object directly, you call a proxy,
➤ The proxy adds some extra behavior (like logging, caching, security checks, or lazy initialization),

Then optionally delegates the call to the real object.

🔄 Intent
➤ To control access to an object
➤ To add functionality without changing the original class
➤ To manage lifecycle or performance (like lazy loading)

🔄 Structure
1️⃣ Subject (Interface)
    ✔️ Common interface shared by both RealObject and Proxy.
2️⃣ RealSubject (Actual Class)
    ✔️ The real object that performs the actual logic.
3️⃣ Proxy (Substitute Class)
    ✔️ Implements the same interface as RealSubject.
    ✔️ Controls access, performs extra tasks, or defers object creation.
4️⃣ Client
    ✔️ Uses the Subject interface; doesn’t know whether it’s talking to the real object or proxy.

✅ Example — Internet Access Proxy
Let’s say an organization wants to restrict internet access for employees.
Employees should only access certain websites, and all requests must pass through a proxy.

1️⃣ Define the Subject Interface
interface Internet {
    void connectTo(String serverHost) throws Exception;
}

2️⃣ Real Object
class RealInternet implements Internet {
    @Override
    public void connectTo(String serverHost) {
        System.out.println("Connecting to " + serverHost);
    }
}

3️⃣ Proxy Class
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class ProxyInternet implements Internet {
    private Internet realInternet = new RealInternet();
    private static List<String> bannedSites;

    static {
        bannedSites = new ArrayList<>();
        bannedSites.add("abc.com");
        bannedSites.add("xyz.com");
    }

    @Override
    public void connectTo(String serverHost) throws Exception {
        if (bannedSites.contains(serverHost.toLowerCase())) {
            throw new Exception("Access Denied to " + serverHost);
        }
        realInternet.connectTo(serverHost);
    }
}

4️⃣ Client Code
public class ProxyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Internet internet = new ProxyInternet();
        try {
            internet.connectTo("openai.com");
            internet.connectTo("abc.com");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
✅ Output
Connecting to openai.com
Access Denied to abc.com


🔄 Types of Proxies
| Type                 | Description                                                     | Example                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Virtual Proxy**    | Controls access to resource-heavy objects (lazy initialization) | Hibernate Lazy Loading    |
| **Remote Proxy**     | Represents an object in another address space                   | RMI, Web Services         |
| **Protection Proxy** | Adds access control                                             | Security layers in Spring |
| **Caching Proxy**    | Stores results to reduce load                                   | Redis, Caffeine caching   |
| **Logging Proxy**    | Adds logging/tracing before and after real calls                | Spring AOP @Before/@After |


✅ Real-Life Examples in Java
1️⃣ Java RMI (Remote Proxy)
When you use Java RMI:
MyRemoteService service = (MyRemoteService) Naming.lookup("//localhost/Service");
👉 You actually get a proxy that represents the remote object, not the real one.

2️⃣ Spring AOP (Dynamic Proxy)
Spring internally uses JDK Dynamic Proxies (for interfaces) or CGLIB Proxies (for classes) for:
    ✔️ Logging
    ✔️ Transaction management
    ✔️ Security checks
    ✔️ Performance monitoring

✅ Example:
@Service
public class PaymentService {
    @Transactional  // Proxy handles transaction begin/commit/rollback
    public void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Processing payment...");
    }
}
👉 Here, @Transactional creates a proxy around PaymentService which:
1️⃣ Starts a transaction before the method call.
2️⃣ Invokes the real method.
3️⃣ Commits or rolls back transaction afterward.

👉 So your class never directly manages transactions — the proxy handles it.

3️⃣ Hibernate Lazy Loading
When you call entity.getOrders(), Hibernate returns a proxy object that loads the data only when accessed — a Virtual Proxy.

⚖️ Advantages
➤ Adds functionality without changing original code.
➤ Helps implement lazy loading, security, caching, logging easily.
➤ Reduces system load by controlling access.

🚫 Disadvantages
❌ Adds extra layer — slight performance overhead.
❌ Complex to debug sometimes (especially in Spring AOP).
❌ Harder to trace stack calls if many proxies are chained.

✅ Spring Boot Example — Logging Proxy
Let’s create a manual proxy that adds logging before calling the real service.

🔁 Service Interface
public interface PaymentService {
    void pay(double amount);
}

🔁 Real Service Implementation
@Service
public class PaymentServiceImpl implements PaymentService {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment of Rs." + amount);
    }
}

🔁 Proxy Implementation (Manual)
@Component
public class PaymentServiceProxy implements PaymentService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public PaymentServiceProxy(PaymentServiceImpl paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    @Override
